I'm Dan Lecocq, and I'm a computer scientist.

I'm currently in my first year at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia where I am enrolled in the MS program in applied mathematics and computational science.  I recently graduated from the Colorado School of Mines with a BS in computer science.

I was previously a TA for CSM's CSCI407 - Scientific Computing and I had a blog with <a href="http://dan.lecocq.us/csci407">support materials</a> for the course, but I no longer actively maintain that.  If anything here strikes your fancy (projects, code, etc.) or what have you send me a comment or email and I'd be happy to talk to you.
