I've been saying all break that I was going to go skiing/snowboarding, but I'm actually going to be going tomorrow. Around 4:00 PM this afternoon, I called a friend and we made plans to spend the next couple of days in 山形 (Yamagata) skiing/snowboarding.

It's about $150 US for transportation, a day of snowboarding with rentals, a hotel, another day of snowboarding, and then transportation back. I don't think that's too bad relative to the JASSO scholarship.

I feel like a total nerd, but I actually went online and read a tutorial on snowboarding before packing my backpack and getting some shut-eye. We leave for the train station in about four and a half hours, and we should be on the mountain by 9:30 or so. Exciting!

If I'm still alive, I will post pictures.
