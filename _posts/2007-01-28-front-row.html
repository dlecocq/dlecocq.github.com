This is Front Row - a little media center that ships with OS X that works wonderfully with the apple remote that comes with MacBooks, iMacs and Mac Minis.<br /><br />The video is a little joggy, and that's a symptom of the screen capture tool, not the actual performance.  (I have the screen capture tool set to 10 fps as opposed to 30 or so.)<br /><embed style="width:400px; height:326px;" id="VideoPlayback" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=-3712420593176886051&hl=en" flashvars=""> </embed>
