We've finally gotten into the warm weather here in Sendai, with up to 21 C (70 F).  I bought a lawn chair and enjoyed my first chance to stretch out on my porch with a beer in hand.  I could get used to sunlight.<br /><br />I bought a video camera that I'm excited to use.  This means that friends and family will actually see some pictures when I get back (if you're lucky!), so look forward to it.  Hopefully it won't be boring vacation clips.  ( http://www.amazon.com/VPC-CA6OR-Weatherproof-Digital-Camcorder-Optical/dp/B000DZKVSS/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3/102-2275879-9761733?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1177905210&sr=8-3 )<br /><br />It turns out, I've listened to approximately 26 days of music in iTunes since I bought my Mac in December.  That's roughly 1/5th my life listening to iTunes.  I find this relatively surprising.
