I met with my professor this week, and he said that my project seemed good.  I have been working on it for a couple months now, and needed his approval in order to complete it, so I'm glad to have gotten it.  There's still a lot more to be done, and I have to give a couple of brief presentations (one, I think has to be 日本語で, but I'm not entirely certain).  There's also an abstract we're supposed to write when all is said and done, but it's trivial.<br /><br />Japanese test tomorrow.  Yesterday I started working my way through the 573 words we are supposed to know.  I still have 170 left, and it's 1 pm, day before.  I'll have the vocab under control by then, but I still have to worry about the grammar portion.
