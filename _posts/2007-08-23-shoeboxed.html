I read about <a href="http://shoeboxed.com">Shoeboxed</a> today on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/shopping/organize-your-receipts-at-shoeboxedcom-291543.php">Lifehacker</a>, and have been trying it out.  Up until this point, I really do keep physical receipts in a shoebox or binder (and probably still will) and have been tagging e-mailed receipts as such in Gmail, and then archiving them.  That was all fine and dandy, but it's nice to have something that's built just for that.  I took all my old Gmail-stored receipts from such various places as Basegear.com and Potion Factory, and it recognized them as receipts without a hitch and found the right amount in the e-mail.  Well-done Shoeboxed.

It reminds me of a service called <a href="http://www.keyfiler.com/">KeyFiler</a> which lets you store your registration keys for software, etc. in a safe, secure and accessible place.
