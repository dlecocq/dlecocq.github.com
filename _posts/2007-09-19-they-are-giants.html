I've only been waiting since the tenth grade to see They Might Be Giants.  Every time I've wanted to see them when they come to Boulder, it's been a 21+ show.  But this time, something is different.

No.  I'm not 21.  It's a 14+ show.

Tomorrow (Thursday), Boulder Theater.

Alan and I are going to rock our faces out and then get ready to atone, 'cause Yom Kippur starts on Friday night.
