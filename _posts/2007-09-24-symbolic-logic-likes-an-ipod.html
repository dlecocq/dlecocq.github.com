I've been wanting to make myself a nice little iPod case out of a book.  Until now, I had been waiting for a sufficiently nerdy book to find its way to me.

I had to go to the Longmont Public Library to get a copy of Slaughterhouse Five (Kurt Vonnegut), and thought I'd check their used books table.  Nothing quite nerdy enough.  In the basement, however, where they keep all of their free books, I found a book from simpler times: Introduction to Logic.  Old, antiquated (this edition, not logic itself), and just nerdy enough.  I spent about $2.60 on magnets to embed in it so that it would remain closed when jostled, and a little Elmers glue, an razor blade, and a little bit of time, and I've got myself a nice little iPod case.

The process will invariably have to begin again when I finally decide to go for a next generation iPod, but until then.
