I've been putting together a media server for my newly-hacked <a href="http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/2007/09/24/xbmc/">XBox media center</a>, and I had an old 120 gig hard drive laying around that wasn't seeing much use.  I thought I'd throw it in the box, giving me 240 gigs total to keep online for my viewing pleasure.  The problem was, however, that I had removed the shunt at some point, and couldn't find one around the house (who keeps these, anyway)?  So, presenting my very ghetto make-shift shunt:

<a href='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/sany0050.png' title='Ghetto Shunt'><img style="float:left;margin:5px" src='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/sany0050.thumbnail.png' alt='Ghetto Shunt' /></a>Made from one of those yellow connectors (if you know the name of what I'm talking about, please let me know), I snapped off the part where you put the wire in and then clamp it with pliers.  Before using that, I made sure I had the right setting (I wanted this one as the slave HD), by touching a screwdriver to the two pins associated with that setting and held it there as I booted the machine.  Probably a safe/smart move (but in all reality, how much current flows through those pins, anyway?).
