This weekend I submitted three scholarship applications totaling about $12,000; the third of these was the <a href="http://www.alvincoxmemorial.com/">Alvin J. Cox Memorial Scholarship</a>.  Applicants were allowed to pick their own topic, and no word limits.  This essay is a little more free-form, but it roughly about my enjoyment of science and technology.  <a href='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/essay.pdf' title='Alvin J.
