Apparently <a href="http://googlified.com/2007gmail-updates-storage-estimation/">Google is increasing storage</a> at a faster rate - a rate which will put our Gmail storage at 6 Gb by January 2008.  I personally enjoy signing into Gmail every day and taking a glance at their storage counter.

Like passing a 10k mile mark on your car, who doesn't get a kick out of seeing lots of 9's turn into lots of 0's?  I've been waiting for the 3000 Mb mark for a while, and with the new rate, it'll be happening tonight around 6:20 Mountain Time.  Would it be nerdy to actually go to my computer and visit the site just to see it turn?  Maybe.  I'll post screen shots if I'm nerdy enough and victorious.

I'm now accepting bets on whether or not confetti will fall from the ceiling when it hits 3 gigs.
