I don't think I'm alone in not having "done" Halloween since the 6th grade, but I find myself wondering if I'm too old to get candy from strangers.

Either way, I've decided to party up this October 31st nerdy-style.  Gonna find / make myself some steampunk goggles and pick up a lab coat.  I've been <a href="http://www.evilmadscientist.com/article.php/LEDMinifigs">carving up LEGO mans</a> and ordered a couple of bags of LEDs for them.  If I feel particularly festive, I might try to carve <a href="http://www.evilmadscientist.com/article.php/DalekPumpkin">a Dalek</a>.
