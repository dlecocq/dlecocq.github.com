Beer can golf - greatest thing ever.  Grab yourself a smoke, some beers, some empties and a blunt object and have yourself a time.

1. Place cigar/cigarette in mouth, ignite.
2. Open yourself the first of your beers and begin consumption.  
3. Line up a few empties at a time.
4. Swing away.
5. Repeat ad infinitum or until you run out of time.
