WÃ¼t for Leopard.

I've been enjoying the hell out of Apple's new OS - you can read about its awesomeness elsewhere.  I will express my surprise, however, that they are using a picture of <a href="http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2007/10/leopard-bsod-ic.html">Windows' BSOD</a> as the icon for network PCs.  So... smug.  I hope people are laughing about this as much as I am.

I was wary of the semi-transparent top bar, but the only thing I didn't like about it was Google Notifier's icon indicating that I have no unread mail.  It... used... white..., not... transparent.  I think you'll agree it looked awful:

Much better after deleting the white bits and making them transparent:
