I read about <a href="http://zipskinny.com">ZipSkinny.com</a> on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/community/get-city-information-with-zipskinny-318343.php">Lifehacker</a> a couple of days ago, and it's actually pretty neat.  I never knew how white, educated, upper-middle-class middle-aged parent-like <a href="http://zipskinny.com/index.php?zip=80504&x=0&y=0">my community</a> was.  How did it escape my attention?

Still, I do get a certain amount of pride from the education level of Colorado, and especially the Boulder area.  Culture is just dripping from every hemp messenger bag and Birkenstock sandal in Boulder proper.
