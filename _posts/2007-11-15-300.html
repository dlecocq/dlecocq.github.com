I just ran into one of Leopard's "more than 300 new features."  I was wanting to move a plugin into an app's plugin directory, but was told that I could not move it, as the directory was protected.  I guess I'd just have to click Canc... wait.  There's another button off in the distance (well, right next to it).  "Authenticate"?  Let's give that a go.  It prompts me for a username and password, I fill them in and the magic happens.  This is so awesome because it saves me from having to go into Terminal and sudo the command.

In celebration, enjoy xkcd's remarks on <a href="http://xkcd.com/149/">sudo</a>.
