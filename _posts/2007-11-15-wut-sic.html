My first <a href="http://woot.com">woot</a> is just 25 miles away.  I've been keeping my ear to the ground with their RSS feed for the last year or so (and seen a few woot-worthy - though, unfortunately they only ship to the States), but this is my first wooting.  What is my first woot?  A toy I don't need, but I hope to have fun with - <a href="http://www.roboquadonline.com/">Roboquad</a>.

Take a look at some of the videos you can find <a href="http://youtube.com/results?search_query=roboquad&search=Search">around</a> the <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=roboquad">interwebs</a>.

Incidentally, within a week, I've made my second wooting - this time a Roomba Discovery for my parents for Christmas.  Shh - don't tell them.

<strong>Update:</strong> My woot is on my doorstep. (<strong>10:08 11/16/07</strong>)
