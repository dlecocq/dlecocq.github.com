One of my favorite things is when websites show me this when I register:

<a href='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/picture-3.png' title='I hate security'><img src='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/picture-3.png' alt='I hate security' /></a>

It's almost as if they're saying - "we hate strong passwords."  And it makes me trust even more that they're actually hashing it in their database.
