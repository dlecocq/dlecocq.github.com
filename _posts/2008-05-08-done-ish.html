For various reasons, two weeks ago, I feel a week behind in schoolwork.  I have worked harder than I've ever worked for school, caught up, and I'm now almost finished with finals - just one more to go.  A couple days after that, I'll be starting my internship at ReadyTalk, and so the summer is starting to kick off more or less.

The 15th sees my friends and me moving into a place for a summer that promises to be filled with hanging out, organically grown food (Alan works on an organic farm), and wine.
