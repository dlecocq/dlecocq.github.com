I just caught up on the Doctor Who I had missed in the last couple of weeks, and I am just continually impressed at how wrapped up in it I can get.  Seriously, it's so incredibly fantastic.

I realize that watching it makes me kind of a nerd (not that I needed any help in that department), but it just gets me so involved each episode.  Twists, turns, adventure and cleverness, I can't get over how much I enjoy it.
