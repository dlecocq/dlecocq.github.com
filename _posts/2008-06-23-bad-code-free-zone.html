A little over a month ago, I walked into to my brand new job - an internship at ReadyTalk.  Down a corridor, and there's a wall covered with dry-erase boards, with the phrase "Bad-Code-Free Zone."  At first, I thought this was meant to be a sort of inspirational semi-strict policy / challenge to / for developers until about a week later, a jokester erased to the "Bad," leaving us all to imagine a "Code-Free Zone."

A few days later, a "C" disappeared, leaving us without odes of any kind - "ode-Free Zone."

Days later, "Diode-Free Zone," with the accompanying symbol for a diode with a large "NO!" written next to it.  Now, as I get up to go to the bathroom, I'm left thinking about a "Lymph Node-Free Zone."

You know, I never much cared for lymph.
