I was reading about <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/algogeeks">Algorithm Geeks</a>, a Google Group dedicated to algorithm-related questions apparently.  I looked at one of the topics, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/algogeeks/web/unique-elements-in-an-array">Unique Elements in an Array</a>, wondering what the chatter looked like.

To remove duplicate elements of an array, the best way I know is to sort your array, and then do a linear traversal, comparing each to its successor, and when they match, deleting the one of them.  Quicksort is generally the algorithm-of-choice in large part because of its simplicity, but someone on this thread suggested <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort">heapsort</a> - an algorithm of which I had never heard.  I looked it over, and was drawn to the article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap">heaps</a>.  On that page, I was looking at an analysis of the time complexity for building the heap, and I got curious about the summation they present (h/2^h).  So, I took some time and proved its convergence:
