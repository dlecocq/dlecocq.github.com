After tossing and turning in bed for what turned out to be three hours of not being able to sleep, I decided to get on my computer and get some reading done.  Seriously, my RSS client's inbox has been around 700 for a couple of days now.  Sure, I just clicked "mark as read" for a lot of it, but I did get through a serious chunk:

<a href='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/picture-9.png' title='No New Items'><img src='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/picture-9.thumbnail.png' alt='No New Items' /></a>

I remember that around 1 o'clock, I listened to Elliott Smith's "2:45 AM" and hoped it wouldn't come to that.

Tips for getting to sleep?  Leave 'em in the comments.  No meds though.  I kicked my Ambien habit.
