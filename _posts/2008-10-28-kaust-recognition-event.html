I'd like to say a few things that KAUST brought up at the Recognition Event this weekend in Washington, D.C., but KAUST seems to like to be tight-lipped about certain details, and so I will be putting a password on the following entry.  If you're friend / family and would like to read about it, please email me requesting the password.
