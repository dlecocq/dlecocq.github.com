Not long ago we got our third graphics project assigned.  In the first we wrote our own raytracer, and in the second we got familiar with OpenGL and implemented a trackball interface that would load a model and allow the user to rotate it around to see it from different angles.  This third project deals with texturing, however.

The first part was to generate a torus and texture it with a tile-able pattern (we were given a few wood textures and one brick).  Same trackball interface applies.

Next up was to add a way to render a model that's seemingly made out of mirror, reflecting a virtual environment, provided to us by a teacher.  This one seems to be the inside of a building near a window.

Lastly, given a 3D texture (marble), we were to "carve" a model out of that material.  See Isis and the shark made of marble.
