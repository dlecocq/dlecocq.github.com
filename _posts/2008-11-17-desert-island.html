One of those relatively common "getting to know you" games is "Desert Island."  You're given a class of objects (like, CDs), and a number indicating how many you can bring.  In short, if you had to listen to 5 albums for the rest of your life, or read five books, or play the same five board games, which would you choose?

Today's <a href="http://xkcd.com/505/">xkcd</a> was on the subject of being stranded, isolated, with essentially large amounts of time on your hands.  I was so happy reading it, because in one panel he describes that during the character's infinite solitude, he "rederived modern math in the sand... and then some."  This is what I had always imagined when I've played Desert Island.  No distractions - no women, enough food to support me, no video games, no internet.  Just a (let's say noble) quest to further my own knowledge.  Discover.  Explore.  I think of it like being in an enormous library of blank books except for a few basic texts, which you know by heart.  Eternity to fill them.
