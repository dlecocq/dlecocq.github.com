I had to give a talk on complexity theory and NP-completeness, and a friend suggested that I record it and post it for all the children of the world to enjoy.  Well, something like that.

I apologize for my verbal ticks - had I recorded myself beforehand and listened to it, I might have made an effort to correct them.  I make a few mistakes, but overall, I think there have been worse talks.  Enjoy.

(Update: Here's the video on Google Video.  The quality is a little lower than the file above, so I'll leave the link, and the choice to you.)
