For Artificial Intelligence, in order to satisfy the final project requirement, I wrote a small chess-playing agent.  It's not horrible, but it's not going to win any awards.  Still, despite its simplicity, I've noticed that in games against itself, it exhibits some seemingly second-order behaviors, like forks, pins, skewers and so on.  I found that interesting.

I did write a text-based interface for playing against it, but it's tedious to actually use, and so, having done well in graphics, I decided to write a simple GUI in OpenGL.  You can click-and-drag your pieces to where you want them, and then wait for the computer to play.  Here's a screenshot of a game's conclusion:
[caption id="attachment_213" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="A game's conclusion"]<a href="http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/board.png"><img src="http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/board-300x300.png" alt="A game&#039;s conclusion" title="Board" width="300" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-213" /></a>[/caption]

I'd like to give the piece icons transparency on the border so that you can see the underlying square, but that will be a job for tomorrow.  Even as it is, I'm pleased with it.
