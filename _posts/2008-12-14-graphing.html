For Scientific Computing, I decided I wanted to have a grapher with which I could programmatically interface easily.  Of course, there are options other there, from gnuPlot to you-name-it, but I figured that it wouldn't be too hard to write one myself.  Especially since there's a ruby port for OpenGL.

Long story short, I've got something that's not too terrible.  Not perfect, but it's certainly a start:

But then, I thought, "why stop there?"  I figured it wouldn't be that hard to make a 3D version.  While the 2D one will work on any generic function you give it, this 3D one has it hard-coded in right now.  Of course, it wouldn't be too much more to make it more flexible, but given that this took 30 minutes, I'm ok with its rigidity.

We'll see where this goes.  It makes me feel a little nerdy that I'm two days into my winter break, and this is how I've spent some of it.
