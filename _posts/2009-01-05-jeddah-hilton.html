After a series of long flights, we finally arrived at Jeddah International Airport.  A little trouble at immigration, but nothing that prevented me from entering the country.

We make our way through a sea of women in burkhas and men in thawbs onto a bus that's headed to our hotel.  A kid who is from Jeddah but was studying abroad in the States was pointing out sights along the way.  Mostly dreary nods and acknowledging the presence of this or that.

Happy to see the hotel, we entered a gate surrounded by concrete blockades, with Steyr-AUG-assault-rifle-bearing soldiers.  Nearby another guard is perched atop a Hummer, clutching his mounted machine gun.  Not unexpected, but still a little surprising.

We enter the hotel which stuns from the moment you first see it.  Marble everything, and 6 great glass elevators.  The registration desk hands us our schedules, badges, and even SIM cards so we can get local cell phone service while we're here.  (Unfortunately it's not a network that Apple will willingly support, but we have ways.)  In the rooms, they have marbled wood furniture, and a beautiful patio.  I actually feel a little guilty about staying in such a nice place.  Photos to come.
