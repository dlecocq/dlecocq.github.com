As it's my first semester T.A.'ing, it's also my first semester grading.  I picked up the first homework from Prof. Qiu this morning, and I just got done grading it.  There are about 40-45 kids and it took about 3 hours.  So, 4-5 minutes per homework - I can live with that.

Tonight was also the first time that a student in the class scheduled an appointment to get help with her homework.  I hadn't looked at the upcoming homework as they just finished the first assignment, but I was very pleased when I was able to jump right in and know exactly the problem.  It's a great feeling to know the entirety of a class without needing a refresher, and being able to take any section and just go.

In short, so far so good.
