Anyone who knows me knows my obsessions with anagrams and this game, Texttwist.  At one point it actually became relatively problematic - hours and hours spent playing it with Rachel.

Like sudoku before it, I set out on a quest to conquer it.

I downloaded an open-source dictionary, took an hour to parse it out, code a program to compute unique permutations of the input words and see which ones are valid words in English.
