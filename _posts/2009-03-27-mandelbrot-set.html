I take another look at my Mandelbrot code because we recently did a project with antialiasing in a raytracer.  I updated my project so that instead of bouncing light, it would instead sample a point on the complex plane, and determine if it was in the Mandelbrot set, and so on and so forth.

I ran the code with 10 passes and 16,384 by 16,384 pixels (~27 megapixels) on my desktop.  It took about an hour and a half, but this is the picture that came out of it (it's a little big):

I also have a couple of extra pictures that show portions of the set in their detail:
