It occurred to me today that I could render a scene several times with slight perturbations and then mesh them together into a movie.  It took about 15 minutes to render on a cluster at Mines, and then about a minute to stitch together with Mencoder.  At 18 frames per second, here is the result.  Enjoy!

<object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/mWT0UOBTT5Y&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x006699&color2=0x54abd6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/mWT0UOBTT5Y&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x006699&color2=0x54abd6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>
