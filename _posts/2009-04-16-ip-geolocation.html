There are a million services out there where you type in an IP address and get an estimate as to its location.  A few months ago I stumbled across a free IP geolocation database because I find myself using online services from time to time - I was sort of surprised how often it's helpful to know where traffic is coming from (outside of Google Analytics, etc.).

Using the <a href="http://www.iplocationtools.com/sql_database.php">database</a> I found, I threw together a script that takes a list of domain names and / or IP addresses and gives you an idea of where it lives:

<code>
dan-lecocqs-macbook:~ dlecocq$ ipquery google.com
 209.85.171.100        Mountain View, US 94043 37.4192 -122.0570
dan-lecocqs-macbook:~ dlecocq$ ipquery yahoo.com
 68.180.206.184            Sunnyvale, US 94089 37.4249 -122.0070
dan-lecocqs-macbook:~ dlecocq$ ipquery apple.com
  17.251.200.70            Cupertino, US 95014 37.3042 -122.0950
dan-lecocqs-macbook:~ dlecocq$ ipquery mines.edu
