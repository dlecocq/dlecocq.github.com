It's all well and good to be able to render shapes in space in a photorealistic way, but at some point you'd like to draw something that doesn't have just one surface color.  After all, a billboard isn't just a bunch of shapes each of which has one color - it's one object with paint / ink placed on it in an ordered way.

Texturing accomplishes by taking a primitive shape (like a sphere, triangle, surface of revolution, etc.) and wrapping an image onto and over it.  Let's consider a sphere in space:

Now let's say we mean it to be Earth.  Then we can take a picture of Earth that's flat:

and then map it onto a sphere to get a picture of what we all know Earth to look like:
