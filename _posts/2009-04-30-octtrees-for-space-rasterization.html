Raytracing is slow.  Incredibly slow.  <em>Painfully</em> slow.  That's because you've got to check a lot of things to accurately determine what you're seeing, if it's in shadow, if it reflects off of something, etc., so it helps quite a bit to be able to get an idea beforehand of where everything is.  Enter octtrees.

We've got a picture of a model (in this case, the Stanford bunny model).  It consists of thousands of tiny triangles that make a surface.  Then, imagine a cube surrounding the entire model.  If there are two many triangles in that cube, you cut the cube in to eight smaller cubes, and repeat.  What this build is a tree where "busy" portions of the space get divided more.

And now for pretty pictures:

I'm finishing up the implementation, and then I'll be using it as part of my octtree as a intersection speedup.
