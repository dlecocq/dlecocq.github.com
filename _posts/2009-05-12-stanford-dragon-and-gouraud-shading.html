I recently finished up school, and part of that was finishing up my ray tracing project.  At the last minute, I implemented Gouraud shading which is a technique to try to smooth out a triangulated surface.  What it really does is just linearly interpolate the normal vectors, where the normal of a vertex is calculated as a weighted average of the normals of the triangles using that vertex.

Long story short:

Also, thanks to an improvement in my parallelization of the problem and a speedup in octtree traversal, I was able to render the Stanford dragon model (~1 million triangles):
