I've come out to the D.C. area for a workshop put on by the DOE, but that's not until this weekend.  In the mean time, I've been spending time with friends from high school (currently Michael in Annapolis, MD).

I got into town on the Fourth of July, and was fortunate enough to meet up with Michael and some friends before the fireworks.  I've only been here a couple of times, but still I've never seen it so crowded.  We got to watch from Pat's parents' boat, docked in the Potomac.  Thanks again, Diane and Bill!

We hung out, had some food and occupied ourselves with the overactive children.  (Actually, we got a little peace and quiet when I handed the troublesome trio a logic game on the iPhone - they got so absorbed in it they sat calmly for two hours!)

The fireworks started at a quarter past nine, but it was one of the weakest shows I've seen, though I've been spoiled by Mines' E-Days display (if you <em>ever</em> have the chance to see that event, it is <em>imperative</em> that you do so).
