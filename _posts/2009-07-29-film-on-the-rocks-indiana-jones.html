If you have never been to Red Rocks, I encourage you to do so and <a href="http://www.redrocksonline.com/pages/events/FOTR.html">Film on the Rocks</a> is a great opportunity to make that happen.  Jennifer and I went last night to see "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade."

I found out earlier this year that the location the powers-that-be chose for the final resting place of the Holy Grail was Petra (البتراء), located in Jordan.  Living in the region, I've added to my growing list of places to visit.  What I did not remember from seeing the movie as a child was the opening scenes where young Indiana steals an artifact from would-be pillagers.  But now having been to Moab only weeks ago, I recognized the setting as Utah's <a href="http://www.nps.gov/arch/index.htm">Arches National Park</a>.  I felt a strange sense of pride having seen the wilderness where Phuong and I spent three days in a pop-culture movie.
