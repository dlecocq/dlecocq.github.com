In the vein of relentless self-improvement, one of the neatest things I've come across lately is <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>.  It's a list of now 251 problems in math, programming, scripting and algorithms.  Sometimes the problems are more in the vein of what Doctor Who called "recreational mathematics:"
<blockquote>
Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
</blockquote>

to more lexicographical things:
<blockquote>
If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?
</blockquote>

At any rate, it's a really great set of problems and good programmatic and analytical practice.  Like <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=67">Problem 67</a> where the difference between a brute force attack and an efficient solution could easily be "over twenty billion years."
