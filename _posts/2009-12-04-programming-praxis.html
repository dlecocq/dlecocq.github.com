I'm all for sharpening the saw, and working on little puzzles.  In that vein, I recently came across a site called <a href="http://programmingpraxis.com/">Programming Praxis</a> that suggests tasks from implementing heapsort to writing AI to play the game <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000DMBF?ie=UTF8&tag=dan.lecocq-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00000DMBF">Mastermind</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=dan.lecocq-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00000DMBF" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.

I don't work on their puzzles as often as I like, but if you've got a little bit of free time, they're worth checking out.
