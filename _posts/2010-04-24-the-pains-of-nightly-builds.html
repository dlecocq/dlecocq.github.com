I've been working with WebKit a lot lately.  Specifically, WebGL.  It's fantastic, and it has the potential to change a lot of important applications, but working with nightly builds is... well, frustrating.

I've been using a revision released in December.  Some later revisions have weird behaviors and draw pixelated, but I've finally come across a problem with r52426 that I just can't circumvent - floating-point textures.  They just don't seem to work properly.  I had noticed the bug before, but it wasn't absolutely crucial before.  Rather, the real bug is that you can't initialize floating-point textures from the JavaScript side.

They've fixed this in later versions, but many of these that have this bug fixed also have a problem with gl.viewport, which is pretty mission-critical.  So now I'm sifting through the changelog, hoping to find a release somewhere in the middle that isn't completely broken.

<strong>Update:</strong> Victory! If you're going to be developing WebGL stuff on Mac, I'd recommend WebKit r53036.  It seems to have everything I need (so far) fixed.
