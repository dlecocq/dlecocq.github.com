Living at KAUST comes with certain privileges not extended to Saudi at large.  For example, women do not have to wear abayas on campus, or even scarves to cover their hair.  Men and women are allowed to talk openly, although there are restrictions on fraternization.  Also, women can drive.

Thus, it occurred to me recently - if you're a woman driver in Saudi, you get arrested and then who knows what else.  If you're a woman driver in the US, you get a discount on your car insurance.
