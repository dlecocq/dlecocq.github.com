One of the joys I was hoping to experience here in New York City was to go to a filming of The Colbert Report.  Unfortunately, getting a ticket can be tricky.  There are rarely tickets available, and so you have to sign up to receive notifications when they become available.

If you do not constantly sit on your email, your chances of going are greatly diminished.  I've been trying for about a month, because as a computer scientist, I am often on my email and can usually respond pretty quickly (< 5 minutes).  Today... was my lucky day.  Sort of.

I responded within a minute of receiving a notification, and was pleased that today I had been fast enough.  There were still 40 tickets left!  By the time I had finished filling out the form, there were a mere 28 left.  I'm sure that in a couple of minutes the whole thing had closed off.  It would seem that Colbert's a popular guy.

So, here's the trouble... the filming is on August 23rd, about a week and a half after I leave the city, and mere days before returning to Saudi Arabia.  Just... my... luck.
