Lifehacker recently posted an article for <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5815636/memory-restart-tells-you-when-firefoxs-memory-usage-gets-too-high-and-restarts-it-for-you">Memory Restart</a>, which restarts Firefox when its RAM consumption becomes too high.

To me, it's a pretty clear sign that you've done something wrong if people are writing plugins for you browser to restart it, because it consumes too much RAM with some regularity.
