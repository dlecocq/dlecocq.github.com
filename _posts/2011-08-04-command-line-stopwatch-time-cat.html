If you find yourself with a terminal and you need a stopwatch:
<code>
$> time cat
</code>

Cat(1) by default waits on stdin if no arguments are provided, until an EOF is reached (Ctrl+d). Time(1) waits until the run command terminates, so in effect, it's a stopwatch that runs until you press ctrl+d.
