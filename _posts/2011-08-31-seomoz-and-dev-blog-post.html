I began work almost a month ago at a Seattle company, <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/" title="SEOmoz" target="_blank">SEOmoz</a>. Interesting projects, talented people, and a good place to be. Today I posted my first contribution to their <a href="http://devblog.seomoz.org/" title="Dev Blog" target="_blank">Dev Blog</a> talking about <a href="http://devblog.seomoz.org/2011/08/launching-and-deploying-instances-with-boto-and-fabric/" title="Launching and Deploying Instances with Boto and Fabric" target="_blank">scripting the launching  and deployment of EC2 instances with boto and frabric</a>.
