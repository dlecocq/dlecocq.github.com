Turns out, there's a pretty handy package called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/psutil/" title="psutil" target="_blank">psutil</a> that allows you to not only gain insight into the currently-running process, but other processes, physical and virtual memory usage, and CPU usage. For example:

<pre lang='python'>
import psutil

psutil.phymem_usage().percent
# 31.2
psutil.virtmem_usage().percent
# 0.0
</pre>

Pretty handy tool if you're doing any sort of monitoring!
