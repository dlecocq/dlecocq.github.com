I recently finished reading one of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_mitnick" title="Kevin Mitnick" target="_blank">Kevin Mitnick</a>'s books, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Wires-Adventures-Worlds-Wanted/dp/0316037702/" title="Ghost in the Wires" target="_blank">Ghost in the Wires</a>. Fantastic. I constantly found it amazing that someone had lived that life, hacking, evading capture, changing identities. Reads like an action movie at many points, and in fact, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0159784/" title="Takedown" target="_blank">several</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/" title="War Games" target="_blank">movies</a> have been made loosely (and one very loosely) based on his life. Mitnick often talks about how much the "myth of Mitnick" is inflated or distorted, especially in the media and particularly with the movies.

As it turns out, Mitnick lived briefly in Seattle, and with my interest piqued, I figured I might be able to track down his old apartment. He describes going home one day before realizing his was being followed, and in the course of the description he mentions a few street names and the part of town he lived in. And at the end of the book, there's a photo of the apartment, slightly too grainy to read the name of the building. But clear enough to read the number. A little time with Google Maps and <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=5227+brooklyn+ave,+seattle&ll=47.66676,-122.313173&spn=0.008425,0.019205&t=m&z=16&vpsrc=0&layer=c&cbll=47.667291,-122.314173&panoid=KavdrrIXVgsQzdBGPyfBvg&cbp=12,281.94,,1,0.79" title="Kevin Mitnick's old apartment" target="_blank">found it</a>! Being so close, I figured I'd drop by to take a picture:
