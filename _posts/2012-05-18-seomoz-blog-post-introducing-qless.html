I recently wrote a new <a href="http://devblog.seomoz.org/2012/05/introducing-qless-our-new-job-queue/">dev blog post</a> at SEOmoz about <a href="https://github.com/seomoz/qless">qless</a>, a project I've been working on. It's a queueing system that takes advantage of Redis 2.6's server-side Lua scripting.

Happy queueing!
