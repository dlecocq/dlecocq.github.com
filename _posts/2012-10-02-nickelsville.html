I live a mere stone's throw from a tent city called <a href="http://www.nickelsville.org/" title="Nickelsville" target="_blank">Nickelsville</a>. I'm a little embarrassed to admit that I took the bus past it every day for about 8 months before my mom and dad pointed it out while visiting us. And since, it has remained ever present in my mind whenever I pass it.

About 6 months ago, I became a father. It hasn't all been smiles and giggles, it's taken its toll; but it has been rewarding, and it has given me a better appreciation for parents everywhere. Today on the bus, I overheard a woman who was taking her two children to live there with her. "Do you have enough blankets?" asked another passenger and apparent Nickelsville veteran. I can't fathom in the slightest feeling the way that mother must have felt. Resignation? Relief? Disappointment?

I, like many, have my own political tilt, but I hope this notion transcends agenda. It's at best difficult to say whether or not people have a right to public education, healthcare, food, shelter, etc. Regardless, our collective willingness to provide these things to our citizens reflects our values. Independent of one's 'right' to any of these, what would it say about us as a country if we were dedicated to providing these to our citizens?
