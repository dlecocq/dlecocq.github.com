  <div class="entry-content">Experimentation has a lot to offer us beyond science, but in a different way. Where the scientific method in the lab focuses more on determining with accuracy a value or finding the underlying behavior of some phenomenon, experimentation in this sense is more along the lines of being willing to make mistakes. To take on embarrassment, or exposing your academic or emotional ego to public scrutiny.  Ask questions.  Be curious.  Be humble and childlike.  For Steve Martin fans, be obsequious, purple and clairvoyant.

I think it&#8217;s better to ask an obvious question than to pridefully miss an answer.  Why not learn something?  Wherever you are, you&#8217;ve gotten there or been put there, and have no responsibility to do anything other than what you can.  Richard Feynman talks about this at great length and was often relieved of performance anxiety by that comforting thought.  When he was first appointed as a professor he doubted his qualification.  He doubted himself when he presented a lecture to Einstein and Fermi, but learned to trust in the opinions of those who had put him where he was.  It&#8217;s why we have letters of recommendation - so-and-so thinks you are qualified or have a legitimate interest in getting to where you&#8217;re going based on where you&#8217;ve been.

That said, not only do you not have an obligation to do anything more than you can, but you&#8217;re obligation is to more or less act as you have in the past.  Not to stifle growth or change, but the person you&#8217;ve been is the person that the powers that be have selected.

  <div class="entry-content">One month ago, I stepped onto Saudi Arabian soil for what I anticipated to be a magical experience coming to KAUST. Well, yes and no.

For our first three weeks here, 350+ students were stowed in a hotel. Granted, the Intercontinental is a nice hotel but they told us that they&#8217;d be bringing us here early so that we might get settled - buy the things like blenders and speakers that we needed, and work the kinks out of our newly minted apartments. We did take care of things like applying for iqamas (our residency permits), but outside of that, we were by and large sitting around.

One event they put on for us that I know I enjoyed was they managed to take 100 students into the desert to go four-wheeling.  That was actually pretty awesome.

Five days of orientation beginning the last days of August, largely filled with cultural sensitivity issues and massively behind schedule.  There seems to be some cultural disagreement about punctuality, but with no exaggeration, one of these mornings the <em>opening</em> presentations scheduled for 8 am did not get under way until 10.  And when you tack on an hour-and-a-half commute from the hotel to the campus, you get a bunch of tired students who would much rather be elsewhere. As a final `can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s so&#8217; moment, it was all scheduled during Ramadan - so students who were fasting and who would otherwise be sleeping had to be awake and active.

Getting to campus was another ordeal. We were all very excited to move in, and then largely disappointed to find everything from rodents to black mold, leaky pipes to bottled `leavings&#8217; of construction workers. A few days later, ceilings began to collapse in some units.

At this point, school had started, of course. Like many others, for the first few days of class I was sleeping on a friend&#8217;s couch.  When I and about a dozen other students were scheduled to move in (getting up at 7:30 to come to campus in time), we were told that it would be about an hour until we could be given keys and move in, but ended up waiting 7 hours to be told that there was no way we would be able to move in, and had to go back to Jeddah.

Books for most classes have still not arrived. We haven&#8217;t any clusters online for high-performance computing. In some disciplines, labs won&#8217;t be online until 2010. The second fastest supercomputer in academia sits dormant in the basement of one of our buildings because the data center is not clean.

I would like to make it clear that I understand that anything this big getting off the ground so quickly is bound to have problems. There were going to be wrinkles (if not kinks) to work out, and I can appreciate that. I hope to not descend into a rant as frankly I&#8217;m all ranted out.

There have been perks - the food on campus is free to students for an indeterminate amount of time; our books will be purchased for us this semester; there have been goodies abundant to be had (from t-shirts to thumb-drives).  As much as I love a thumb drive, I would have preferred something else - a home.

That said, the students have mobilized. We&#8217;ve signed petitions, we&#8217;ve organized, and we&#8217;ve gotten interim student representation in place. We wanted to convey the idea that we don&#8217;t want to perpetually complain but would like to help out if that means us coming into a better situation. And despite some of our expectations, within two days, the administration had contacted us to schedule meetings and put us in contact with the contractors in charge of this and that (IT, housing, etc.).  It&#8217;s actually been very inspiring to see the actions we take have tangible results. Had to talked to me two days ago, you would have found me a very tired and disenchanted man, but today I&#8217;m very hopeful.

In terms of academics, I am really happy with the faculty. I&#8217;ve secured a TA position, and I spend a couple hours a day with this prof in a constant stream of geeking out. And I spoke yesterday to a prof for two hours about the research he&#8217;s doing and how I might get involved on that front. Depending on how this goes, I&#8217;d be willing to consider staying on for a PhD!

I&#8217;ve made instant friends with a couple of students here, and three of us have gotten a license to host a local TED event: TEDxKAUST.  We&#8217;ll replay some of our favorite talks, and those we think would be most inspiring to students here, and we hope to get a couple of professors to present as well. In our budget, we&#8217;ve been able to allocate funds to booths and demos and if all goes well (read: gets approved), we&#8217;ll have a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpCquUWqaYw">Ruben&#8217;s Tube</a>.

  <div class="entry-content">In the vein of relentless self-improvement, one of the neatest things I&#8217;ve come across lately is <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>.  It&#8217;s a list of now 251 problems in math, programming, scripting and algorithms.  Sometimes the problems are more in the vein of what Doctor Who called &#8220;recreational mathematics:&#8221;
<blockquote>
Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
</blockquote>

to more lexicographical things:
<blockquote>
If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?
</blockquote>

At any rate, it&#8217;s a really great set of problems and good programmatic and analytical practice.  Like <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=67">Problem 67</a> where the difference between a brute force attack and an efficient solution could easily be &#8220;over twenty billion years.&#8221;

  <div class="entry-content">NPAR (Non-Photorealistic Animation and Rendering) 2009 finished wrapped today and I found it entirely compelling.  Stunning keynotes from Disney/Pixar and Ubisoft reminded me of why I&#8217;m so interested in graphics - pretty pictures.

Going into this, I had anticipated that I would be far out-shined by the presenters and papers, but now more than ever I feel as though I can really compete with these guys.

I&#8217;m still sort of shopping for a thesis, and there are a million ideas I&#8217;ve come across here to develop.  I&#8217;m keeping a list of techniques I&#8217;d like to apply to these problems and a list of projects and things to implement hopefully in a weekend.  A non-exhaustive list would include:
<ul>
	<li>feature lines in raytracing</li>
	<li>stippling</li>
	<li>perfect tiling of patterns on arbitrary meshes</li>
	<li>exploring space-filling curves</li>
</ul>

Thank you to all the presenters and keynote speakers - you were all fantastic.  And thanks to all the planners and sponsors of the conference.

Today sees the start of the co-located events (I&#8217;m going to NPAR - Non-Photorealistic Animation and Rendering), and I&#8217;m so psyched!  If you&#8217;re at SIGGRAPH or in New Orleans and want to hang out and network, drop me an email / comment!

  <div class="entry-content">When asked recently about why I began in computer science, I realized that it owes a lot to the mother of a friend who worked as a software engineer at Ball Aerospace.  It was my junior year of high school when we spoke at a barbeque:

Katja has M.S. and although I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m uncertain of the specifics, she was confined to a wheelchair at this point.  She asked the powers that be to make the entrance of the building where she worked more wheelchair accessible, and they suggested that when she arrived at work that she could just call the front desk or get the attention of the security guard to have the door opened for her.  She tried to explain to me that, &#8220;it was the door&#8217;s job to open itself.&#8221;

I didn&#8217;t understand what she meant then, but she assured me that someday I would.  She wasn&#8217;t referring to the automatic opener, but rather that it&#8217;s the door&#8217;s responsibility to provide a way to open it.  Whether that&#8217;s a handle, a latch or a button, there shouldn&#8217;t be outside resources that enter into the equation of opening the door.  I don&#8217;t remember the day that I understood it, but it came after taking Data Structures (it seems like a lifetime ago at this point).

During today&#8217;s <a href="http://npar.org">NPAR</a> sessions, it cemented what I had been coming to realize - computer scientists are really philosophers.  We argue about what it means to be a door and by what metrics art should be judged.  We&#8217;re made uncomfortable by hacks that do not obey a cohesive design philosophy and if you talk to any computer scientist worth his weight in gold, he has a sense of the &#8220;right&#8221; way to design something and can substantiate that claim.

All this is especially true of people in graphics, I&#8217;ve found.  The people at NPAR are often concerned with visualization and communicating an idea (after all, our eyes are our highest bandwidth sense).  It&#8217;s one thing to know facts, like the population and GDP of countries over the last 40 years, but it&#8217;s another thing entirely to <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html">have a feel for the trends</a> they describe.  It&#8217;s been said before that &#8220;a picture is worth a thousand words,&#8221; and the goal of any good visualization should be to convey <em>understanding</em>.  We seek to reveal the truth, the &#8220;chairness of the chair,&#8221; and this is goal I feel very strongly about and take to heart at every chance.

This concept is well-summarized by a quote one of the presenters mentioned:

<blockquote>Drawing is not following a line on the model, it is drawing your sense of the thing. - Robert Henri</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content">If you have never been to Red Rocks, I encourage you to do so and <a href="http://www.redrocksonline.com/pages/events/FOTR.html">Film on the Rocks</a> is a great opportunity to make that happen.  Jennifer and I went last night to see &#8220;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.&#8221;

I found out earlier this year that the location the powers-that-be chose for the final resting place of the Holy Grail was Petra (البتراء), located in Jordan.  Living in the region, I&#8217;ve added to my growing list of places to visit.  What I did not remember from seeing the movie as a child was the opening scenes where young Indiana steals an artifact from would-be pillagers.  But now having been to Moab only weeks ago, I recognized the setting as Utah&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nps.gov/arch/index.htm">Arches National Park</a>.  I felt a strange sense of pride having seen the wilderness where Phuong and I spent three days in a pop-culture movie.

  <div class="entry-content">I&#8217;ve come out to the D.C. area for a workshop put on by the DOE, but that&#8217;s not until this weekend.  In the mean time, I&#8217;ve been spending time with friends from high school (currently Michael in Annapolis, MD).

I got into town on the Fourth of July, and was fortunate enough to meet up with Michael and some friends before the fireworks.  I&#8217;ve only been here a couple of times, but still I&#8217;ve never seen it so crowded.  We got to watch from Pat&#8217;s parents&#8217; boat, docked in the Potomac.  Thanks again, Diane and Bill!

<img src='http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3580/3692580812_ab4b101c40.jpg' alt='DSC_0018.JPG'/>

We hung out, had some food and occupied ourselves with the overactive children.  (Actually, we got a little peace and quiet when I handed the troublesome trio a logic game on the iPhone - they got so absorbed in it they sat calmly for two hours!)

<img src='http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2556/3692576114_9bed0155a8.jpg' alt='DSC_0012.JPG'/>

The fireworks started at a quarter past nine, but it was one of the weakest shows I&#8217;ve seen, though I&#8217;ve been spoiled by Mines&#8217; E-Days display (if you <em>ever</em> have the chance to see that event, it is <em>imperative</em> that you do so).

  <div class="entry-content">Last week, Phuong and I went camping for a few days in Moab, UT.  She had never been camping, and I&#8217;d never been in what I&#8217;d consider a real desert.  Despite a few hiccups, it went relatively well.

Moab lives about 350 miles away from home or about 6.5 hours through mountain resorts and podunk towns.  We got a late start and didn&#8217;t show up at our campsite until the early hours of the morning.  Setting up the tent in the dark was not our problem - ours was one of being exhausted after the drive.  Despite it all, the next day saw an enthusiastic start.

<img src='http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3636/3684152511_e89229e5fd.jpg' alt='DSC_0037.JPG'/>

Our first hike was the longest at the park, weighing in at about 7 miles.  The rangers said we should plan on between 3 and 5 hours to hike it.  With only about 1,000 feet in elevation change on the trail, we thought they must be crazy to think it would take that long.  Four hours and two camelbacks later, we realize they were right.

In the desert, they recommend that each person drink 16 ounces of water per hour of exposure.  It is truly an odd sensation to drink a gallon of water per day and not urinate at all - this massive amount of water is completely sweated out.  With more than half of the days of July over 100F (it hit 101 while we were on this hike), Moab is a great and terrible place.

In the middle of our second night there, we awoke to find ourselves being dragged away by the wind&#8230; while still in our tent.  Though we tried desperately to weigh down what we figured were key areas, we had no chance to stay, so we scrambled out as quickly as we could and collapsed the tent.  We were a little late in doing so as the wind had ripped a hole in the fabric, and bent one of the poles in half.  Our camping was coming to a premature close.  We slept in the car that night and decided that the next day we&#8217;d hike some of the easier trails and then head home.

I&#8217;ve got <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/danlecocq/sets/72157620767013871/">dozens of photos from the trip</a> that are worth looking at (especially if you&#8217;ve never been).  Later this summer I&#8217;d like to visit Dinosaur National Monument in western Colorado and/or Glacier National Park.  Time permitting, of course.

  <div class="entry-content">Last night we got a nice bit of lightning out here and so I thought I&#8217;d try to grab some shots.  I got lucky and got a few, but I wish I had stayed out there longer.  You can see the rest of the series and others on my new <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/danlecocq/">flicker account</a>.
