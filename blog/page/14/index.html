  <div class="entry-content">As it&#8217;s my first semester T.A.&#8217;ing, it&#8217;s also my first semester grading.  I picked up the first homework from Prof. Qiu this morning, and I just got done grading it.  There are about 40-45 kids and it took about 3 hours.  So, 4-5 minutes per homework - I can live with that.

Tonight was also the first time that a student in the class scheduled an appointment to get help with her homework.  I hadn&#8217;t looked at the upcoming homework as they just finished the first assignment, but I was very pleased when I was able to jump right in and know exactly the problem.  It&#8217;s a great feeling to know the entirety of a class without needing a refresher, and being able to take any section and just go.

In short, so far so good.

  <div class="entry-content">After a series of long flights, we finally arrived at Jeddah International Airport.  A little trouble at immigration, but nothing that prevented me from entering the country.

We make our way through a sea of women in burkhas and men in thawbs onto a bus that&#8217;s headed to our hotel.  A kid who is from Jeddah but was studying abroad in the States was pointing out sights along the way.  Mostly dreary nods and acknowledging the presence of this or that.

Happy to see the hotel, we entered a gate surrounded by concrete blockades, with Steyr-AUG-assault-rifle-bearing soldiers.  Nearby another guard is perched atop a Hummer, clutching his mounted machine gun.  Not unexpected, but still a little surprising.

We enter the hotel which stuns from the moment you first see it.  Marble everything, and 6 great glass elevators.  The registration desk hands us our schedules, badges, and even SIM cards so we can get local cell phone service while we&#8217;re here.  (Unfortunately it&#8217;s not a network that Apple will willingly support, but we have ways.)  In the rooms, they have marbled wood furniture, and a beautiful patio.  I actually feel a little guilty about staying in such a nice place.  Photos to come.

  <div class="entry-content">I broke down, and I bought one.  I&#8217;m now one of those a**holes walking down the street checking his email.  I want to stay connected, via email and the internet, and also a phone.

See, for what has now become a multi-year bother, my friends have been pestering me about getting a cell phone.  I put it off citing the associated charges and the shortcomings of other phones.  But now, I can do a lot of tedious tasks I used to use my laptop for - checking mail, calling people, reading news, find local movie show times, get directions from point me to point b.  Even listen to my music and watch stupid internet videos.

Simultaneously a great and sad day.

  <div class="entry-content">For Scientific Computing, I decided I wanted to have a grapher with which I could programmatically interface easily.  Of course, there are options other there, from gnuPlot to you-name-it, but I figured that it wouldn&#8217;t be too hard to write one myself.  Especially since there&#8217;s a ruby port for OpenGL.

Long story short, I&#8217;ve got something that&#8217;s not too terrible.  Not perfect, but it&#8217;s certainly a start:
[caption id=&#8221;attachment_216&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;A few functions plotted with my grapher&#8221;]<a href="http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/grapher.png"><img src="http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/grapher-300x300.png" alt="A few functions plotted with my grapher" title="2D Grapher" width="300" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-216" /></a>[/caption]

But then, I thought, &#8220;why stop there?&#8221;  I figured it wouldn&#8217;t be that hard to make a 3D version.  While the 2D one will work on any generic function you give it, this 3D one has it hard-coded in right now.  Of course, it wouldn&#8217;t be too much more to make it more flexible, but given that this took 30 minutes, I&#8217;m ok with its rigidity.
[caption id=&#8221;attachment_217&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;A simple surface.&#8221;]<a href="http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/surface.png"><img src="http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/surface-300x282.png" alt="A simple surface." title="3D Grapher" width="300" height="282" class="size-medium wp-image-217" /></a>[/caption]

We&#8217;ll see where this goes.  It makes me feel a little nerdy that I&#8217;m two days into my winter break, and this is how I&#8217;ve spent some of it.

  <div class="entry-content">For Artificial Intelligence, in order to satisfy the final project requirement, I wrote a small chess-playing agent.  It&#8217;s not horrible, but it&#8217;s not going to win any awards.  Still, despite its simplicity, I&#8217;ve noticed that in games against itself, it exhibits some seemingly second-order behaviors, like forks, pins, skewers and so on.  I found that interesting.

I did write a text-based interface for playing against it, but it&#8217;s tedious to actually use, and so, having done well in graphics, I decided to write a simple GUI in OpenGL.  You can click-and-drag your pieces to where you want them, and then wait for the computer to play.  Here&#8217;s a screenshot of a game&#8217;s conclusion:
[caption id=&#8221;attachment_213&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;A game&#8217;s conclusion&#8221;]<a href="http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/board.png"><img src="http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/board-300x300.png" alt="A game&#039;s conclusion" title="Board" width="300" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-213" /></a>[/caption]

I&#8217;d like to give the piece icons transparency on the border so that you can see the underlying square, but that will be a job for tomorrow.  Even as it is, I&#8217;m pleased with it.

  <div class="entry-content">This day had long been coming - new MacBook day.

Today I bought myself the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/">2.0 GHz MacBook</a>.  It&#8217;s such a beautiful machine, and I think it will be serving me well in the coming years.

I don&#8217;t get the chance to make such a big purchase very often, but when I do, I consider it for a while from afar, and when I make my decision, I walk right in and up to the first employee, point to the computer and say, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to buy that MacBook.&#8221;  &#8220;Do you know which one you want?&#8221;  &#8220;Yes.  This one.&#8221;  From their reactions I have to imagine that they don&#8217;t see this happen very often.  &#8220;And I&#8217;d like to upgrade the ram to 4 gigs.&#8221;  A little confused, they call for someone to ring me up.

I walked into the 29th Street Mall Apple Store at 5:10, bought the thing at 5:20, and was assured that it would be just a few minutes while they switched out the ram.  Forty minutes later, they bring out my computer, and I&#8217;m on my way.  I get home, turn it on - all fun and games until I select &#8220;About This Mac.&#8221;  Only 2 gigs of ram.  I should have prefaced this by saying that this summer, Henrique bought himself a brand new MacBook Pro at this same location, upgraded the ram as I did, and found out the same thing upon arrival as I did - they hadn&#8217;t switched out the ram.

It was too classic for me to be completely irate, but I called the store and told them other places they could put the extra ram.  I&#8217;ll be going in tomorrow morning to get it sorted, but this is unbelievable to me.  Not only that the guy doing the job took out two sticks of ram, looks at the four sticks he now has sitting there, and decides to put the same two in.  Bad as that is, what really gets me is that it takes 40 minutes to not switch out the ram.

That said, I very much enjoy Apple&#8217;s products, and I know a (now ex-) Apple rep or two who&#8217;re good guys, but this is just amazing.

  <div class="entry-content">There&#8217;s a guy who&#8217;s perpetually in alamode (the lab of choice for the C.S. major of discerning taste) named Feineman.  It was through him that I found <a href="http://failblog.org/">failblog</a> - he was tearing through the archive and it had some pretty funny stuff.

Yesterday he found yet another gem.  Apparently there&#8217;s a mutex (mutual exclusion) on sex and studying engineering:

  <div class="entry-content">I received an email this morning with my login credentials for new KAUST email address.  Those of you who would like this address, please email me at the current address you have for me.

At any rate, it really solidifies the KAUSTiness, and is oddly gratifying.  I&#8217;m very excited for this.

  <div class="entry-content">I had to give a talk on complexity theory and NP-completeness, and a friend suggested that I record it and post it for all the children of the world to enjoy.  Well, something like that.

I apologize for my verbal ticks - had I recorded myself beforehand and listened to it, I might have made an effort to correct them.  I make a few mistakes, but overall, I think there have been worse talks.  Enjoy.
