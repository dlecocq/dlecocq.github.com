  <div class="entry-content">Computers are awesome.  They crunch numbers at mind-boggling speeds.  Had the automotive industry kept pace with the computer industry for the last 40-50 years, the average car would cost $15 and fit in your pocket.

That said, there are limitations.  Computer vision and artificial intelligence still have a long way to go.  Even if we do get those things sorted out, there are still a large number of important problems that don&#8217;t have quick solutions in all likelihood.  This is where people step back into the picture.

Luis van Ahn has done a lot of work in the field.  Most notably, the <a href="http://images.google.com/imagelabeler/">Google Image Labeler</a>, where two players work together to label photos with relevant tags.  Traditionally, image search engines had to rely on the name of the image, as well as words orthographically near it to guess at the contents.  A human can do this much more reliably by simply looking at the image.

So, people are good at some things, and computers are good at others.  And so it&#8217;s very possible that computing in the near future will be more of a team effort for certain projects.  Computers doing the heavy lifting in terms of cataloging, aggregating, recording, crunching, and humans doing the interpretive stuff.  <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5099746/solve-puzzles-to-help-out-scientists">Lifehacker</a> had an article recently about a tool called <a href="http://fold.it/portal/">Foldit</a> that turns manipulating virtual proteins into a game.  People can do certain really complicated tasks easier than a computer could, and untangling proteins is apparently one of them.

To give you an idea of how many &#8220;human clock cycles&#8221; are wasted, in 2003, 9 billion hours were spent playing computer solitaire.  If you have 50 minutes to yourself and would like to hear a really good lecture, <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8246463980976635143&hl=en">van Ahn</a> gives a great presentation.

  <div class="entry-content">A couple of weeks ago now, I spoke to a professor about the possibility of T.A.&#8217;ing next semester&#8217;s CSCI407 - Scientific Computing.  It was one of my favorite classes at Mines, and I&#8217;m really looking forward to it.  The professor will not be on campus from March onward, and so it will be an online class from that point, but I&#8217;ll likely be holding regular class hours during that time.  Exciting!

This is all because one of my few regrets about KAUST is that I wouldn&#8217;t get a chance to T.A. or teach there as a student, so, I&#8217;m pursuing that here.

So, if you&#8217;ve still got Sci. Comp. left to take, take it next semester.  I hear they&#8217;re going to have a sweet T.A.!

  <div class="entry-content">The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">Mandelbrot set</a> is one of those things you&#8217;ve always seen on posters or in your math book, but never knew what it was actually.  Well, it was that way for me, until recently.

It&#8217;s a graph of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane">complex plane</a>, in which each point has an associated value.  This value is determined by the series:

$$ x_{n+1} = x_{n}^{2} + c$$

where c is the point in question.  If this value does not approach infinity, then it&#8217;s contained in the set, and is colored in black.  Otherwise, its color is determined by how fast it grows (and there are a number of ways of doing this).

A new friend of mine, Johnny, adapted code from one of our graphics projects to render the set, and so I had to do the same.  Not one-upsmanship, but how awesome is that for a project.  That said, this is the result of my work so far, but I plan to develop a better coloring scheme, as well as adding interactivity and exploratory tools to the interface.

  <div class="entry-content">Memory management is a notoriously difficult aspect of coding in C++.  Generally, the problems one runs into with pointers is that you get rid of the data you&#8217;re pointing to while you still need it.  Gdb has become a good friend for finding segmentation faults.

For those of you who aren&#8217;t computer scientists, here&#8217;s a quick explanation - we need space to store variables and information.  So, one way to do this is ask the system for some space, and then the system gives back an address.  Imagine mailboxes at the post office - you don&#8217;t have the stuff stored in your mailbox with you at all times, but rather the way (the key) to access it.  One problem that arises when you tell the post office you don&#8217;t need the mailbox anymore, but you don&#8217;t give back the key.  Someone else is assigned this mailbox, and his mail starts arriving in there, and when you go looking for yours, it&#8217;s not what you expect (this often causes a segmentation fault).  The other problem is when one patron keeps requesting mailboxes, and you&#8217;re only allowed to hold one key at a time, so you discard the old ones.  If you request too many, no mailboxes are left (this is a memory leak)!

At any rate, I don&#8217;t have much experience tracking down memory leaks, and so when I came across this problem, I asked an open question to everyone in the lab of the best way to do this.  Someone suggested I put soapy water on my program and look for bubbles.

I ended up looking through my code for places where this might be happening, and I happened to find it pretty quickly.  That&#8217;s pretty lucky.

  <div class="entry-content">I&#8217;m reading &#8220;Surely You&#8217;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!&#8221; which is, by the way, fantastic.  He is instantly likable, and his stories are incredible in many ways.  I was reading last night when I came across a passage about him watching a paramecium under a microscope:

<blockquote>
I watched these paramecia hit something, recoil, turn through an angle, and go again.  The idea that it&#8217;s mechanical, like a computer program - it doesn&#8217;t look that way.  They go different distances, they recoil different distances, they turn through angles that are different in various cases; they don&#8217;t always turn to the right; they&#8217;re very irregular.  It looks random, because you don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re hitting; you don&#8217;t know all the chemicals they&#8217;re smelling, or what.
</blockquote>

In light of this, I suggest a new metric for judging artificial intelligence - the Paramecium Turing Test.  The paramecium chats with two agents for five minutes, and tries to decide which one&#8217;s a computer.

  <div class="entry-content">A little game I play with myself sometimes that&#8217;s somewhat along the lines of Desert Island is this (I don&#8217;t have a name for it): If you suddenly found yourself way back in time, what would you bring (intellectually, academically) back from modern times?

Try it for different time periods.  For example, if it were 5000 B.C., would you, say, know how to smelt?  I guess I try to put things in the context of the big ideas / advances of the time.

If it were the 1400&#8217;s, could you demonstrate that the earth was round?  If it were the 1700&#8217;s or so, could you explain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations">Maxwell&#8217;s equations</a>?  Late 1800&#8217;s - relativity?  Quantum mechanics?  Wave-particle duality?

This sometimes makes me wish I knew how to smelt.

  <div class="entry-content">One of those relatively common &#8220;getting to know you&#8221; games is &#8220;Desert Island.&#8221;  You&#8217;re given a class of objects (like, CDs), and a number indicating how many you can bring.  In short, if you had to listen to 5 albums for the rest of your life, or read five books, or play the same five board games, which would you choose?

Today&#8217;s <a href="http://xkcd.com/505/">xkcd</a> was on the subject of being stranded, isolated, with essentially large amounts of time on your hands.  I was so happy reading it, because in one panel he describes that during the character&#8217;s infinite solitude, he &#8220;rederived modern math in the sand&#8230; and then some.&#8221;  This is what I had always imagined when I&#8217;ve played Desert Island.  No distractions - no women, enough food to support me, no video games, no internet.  Just a (let&#8217;s say noble) quest to further my own knowledge.  Discover.  Explore.  I think of it like being in an enormous library of blank books except for a few basic texts, which you know by heart.  Eternity to fill them.

  <div class="entry-content">It took me about three hours, but I got my fourth graphics project pretty much done.  A little polish in terms of user interface, and one little feature, but that&#8217;s it.

The project is dealing with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi">Voronoi diagrams</a>, and so the first part was to generate a random set of points, and then the associated Voronoi diagram:

[caption id=&#8221;attachment_148&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;A Voronoi diagram&#8221;]<a href="http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/voronoi.png"><img src="http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/voronoi-300x282.png" alt="A Voronoi diagram" title="Voronoi" width="300" height="282" class="size-medium wp-image-148" /></a>[/caption]

The next step was to actually create a mosaic.  The idea is that the whole Voronoi region should be the color of the point on the picture that corresponds to the associated Voronoi point.  At any rate, what it comes down to is pretty pictures.  I&#8217;ve included the original and mosaic version for some of the pictures we were provided.
