  <div class="entry-content">My friends are not computer science, but I&#8217;ve talked about NP-Completeness enough for them to know to zone out when the phrase comes up.  I find the topic extremely fascinating, as at some level I feel like Algorithms courses are where math best meets computer science.  Well, outside of scientific computing.  Or graphics.  Regardless, the two disciplines meet here.

Reading <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001187.html">Coding Horror</a>, I found this gem:

<blockquote>
NP-complete problems are like hardcore pornography. Nobody can define what makes a problem NP-complete, exactly, but you&#8217;ll know it when you see it. Just this once, I&#8217;ll refrain from my usual practice of inserting images to illustrate my point.
</blockquote>

Hilarious.  The rest of the article is good, too.

Recently, my friends and I were at my school&#8217;s Divali festival.  It was very crowded, and it was tough to find a set of three consecutive chairs at any table for us to all sit at.  I recognized this immediately as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing">bin-packing</a>, an NP-hard problem.  Basically, the tables are bins, and you have groups of various sizes (some people came alone, some in pairs, etc.) that you want to fit into these bins wasting as little space as possible / using as few tables as possible.  Another example of this problem might be going to the movie theatre with your friends / family.  My friends got bored pretty quickly when I brought this up.

  <div class="entry-content">I just submitted my application for a the <a href="https://clscholarship.org/home.php">Critical Language Scholarship</a>, which would put me in an Arab country (Tangiers, Morocco; Cairo, Egypt; Amman, Jordan; or Beirut, Lebanon) for 7 - 10 weeks for an intensive program in Arabic.  I hope to travel around the Middle East for a couple weeks before that (we&#8217;ll see how the visa situation turns out), but I thought I&#8217;d share the essays I wrote for my application now that the process is essentially over.

(In addition to this program, I will be applying to two other similar programs, although one of those would take place in California, and not a foreign country.)

1) Please explain how you become interested in studying Arabic and what preparation you have done to date to learn about the region.

<blockquote>
Suffice it to say, Arabic is a language not  traditionally studied in the West. Given its relative rarity, it has always held a very intense exotic appeal to me. It has the most gorgeous script of any language I&#8217;ve encountered, and I find spoken Arabic striking. The Middle East is thus a land of mystery intrigue, and Arabic provides a gateway.

I have a habit of asking every person with an accent that I meet where he comes from. In this way, I’ve met many interesting people here in the States: Persians, Israelis, South Koreans, Saudis, Moroccans, Jordanians, and many others. Granted, these people are all of a certain type—the kind of person willing to pack up and move to another country. With each person, especially those from the Middle East, I ask as many questions as possible about relations between their country and others, cultural perspectives, lifestyle and so on.

While in Washington D.C, I made friends with some Moroccan men, and we talked at length in French about life in the United States compared to in Morocco. On the same trip, I spoke to a Saudi man named Jafer about the culture, and especially the lessening of Sunni-Shia tensions. My friend, Shireen, is half Iranian and I’ve spoken to her and her father at great length about Iran’s history and the relationship of the citizens with the government before and after the revolution and war.

I devour any article I can find about the Middle East, from the leaders of countries to the wars and international relations. From al-Dahabi to Ahmadinejad’s personal web log. When I can, I like to watch Al-Jazeera English, and on my nightstand sits a copy of Edward Said&#8217;s &#8220;The Politics of Dispossession.&#8221;
</blockquote>

2) Please explain what you hope to obtain from participation in this intensive language program and how it will contribute to your immediate and long-range goals. Within your response, please include answers to the following questions:

a. How does the program fit into your academic career? 
b. What are your career goals and how does study and mastery of this language contribute toward meeting those goals? 

<blockquote>
When learning a language in the classroom, despite earnest attempts by teachers to incorporate the associated culture, I find that one gets a more or less sterile lesson of the language. In high school, I took four years of French, but it wasn’t until I spent a good deal of time there that I felt like I knew the language. I didn’t form sentences in English and translate them anymore , but learned to think, dream, and speak directly in French. It’s the difference between knowledge by description and knowledge by acquaintance. What I hope to gain from participating in this program is to not just read and write better Arabic, but also to live it.

In terms of my academic career, I will be matriculating to the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia, a mere 80 kilometers from the cultural hub that is Jeddah. I think part of the academic lifestyle is living the collegiate culture in the surrounding areas. And of course this means diving into Arabic.

With respect to career/personal goals, I think it’s very important to be a world citizen—acquainted with many languages, cultures and traditions. I think it’s virtuous in its own right, but also it promotes international understanding. As a career, I’d like to find work in diplomacy or intelligence—anything to help keep the peace and advance world relations. I see spending time overseas as a tremendous boon to this career decision.
</blockquote>

3) Please explain how you expect to build upon the experience of participating in this intensive language program. Within your response, please include answers to the following questions:

a. What language courses do you plan to take in the future?
b. What resources are available to you to further your study of the language? This may include resources through your college or university, community organizations, personal or professional contacts, or other institutions. 
c. If language courses are not offered at your institution, what specific steps will you take to continue your language study?

<blockquote>
I don’t think of the Arab world as just a place to do my graduate studies, but rather a place I’d like to frequent during my lifetime. In that sense, I don’t want to participate in this program as an isolated event.

KAUST (the graduate school I’m attending in Thuwal, KSA) will be offering a certain number of intensive short-form classes in Arabic of which I plan to take full advantage. Beyond the traditional classroom approach, I’d certainly be interested in pursuing subsequent CLS programs in future summers.

In addition to organized Arabic education, there will be a significant Arabic-speaking community at KAUST. Within this community I hope to make many friends and to practice Arabic with them while participating in their culture and traditions.

Beyond even this student body, there are 27 million Arabic-speakers in the country to speak with. And, being in such proximity to Jeddah means a chance to walk the streets and experience the home life of Arab culture. Jeddah is merely the beginning. With so many interesting countries nearby—Jordan, Egypt, Qatar, Bahrain, Yemen, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates to name a few—I expect to feel a very powerful wanderlust during my time there. I am a strong believer that a large part of really knowing a language is getting into the thick of it. Initiating conversations, getting in just a little over your head in terms of linguistic ability, using the wrong verbs, and discovering beyond the denotation of words to their cultural connotations. My time at KAUST (which may last up to five years) will be filled with such opportunity.
</blockquote>

4) The intensive language program will offer an exciting opportunity for students to be immersed in a foreign culture. The program will also offer many challenges. Please explain what experiences and unique personal qualities you would bring to program. Within your response, please include the following information:

a. Please describe any living/working experiences you have had, either overseas or in the US (such as in the classroom, in dormitories or residences, work or volunteer activities, etc.) where you have been required to interact with people from backgrounds different than your own. 
b. Please describe how you have dealt with challenging living situations or different cultural situations, and how you plan to deal with experiences that may be quite different from those you may have encountered previously in the US.
c. Please describe the unique personal qualities you would bring to the group. 

<blockquote>
I have a fair amount of international experience - my father is French and the majority of my extended family lives overseas. Cumulatively, I have probably spent 4-6 months living there amidst French culture—the museums, the cheese, and the late nights arguing about politics.  Many of my close friends are also first generation Americans with parents coming from Mexico, Vietnam, South Africa, Iran, and Jordan. Stepping into their households is like getting a glimpse of their home country.

I spent a year in Japan studying abroad, during which I travelled and talked with many Japanese people. From gathering with my research lab for dinner to going to Sapporo’s international snow festival. Beyond the Japanese experience, only a small minority of the students studying abroad there were American. Indonesian to Kazakhstani, we all got along and learned each other’s ways. As Americans we hosted a Thanksgiving dinner. Some Indian students invited us to celebrate Diwali, and Muslim students, Eid ul-Fitr.

Challenges do arise, but I believe that compromise is the essence of diplomacy. For example, while Tisha B’Av, one refrains from going to parties. This coincided with a close friend’s birthday party, and so in order to remain friendly, I made a brief appearance. Other times it&#8217;s just a matter of learning new norms. Like properly setting down chopsticks in Japan, or entering a room with your right foot in Muslim communities. I do my best when I encounter these differences to incorporate them as a show of respect, no matter how odd or challenging I might find them.

In terms of unique characteristics I bring, I have already a colorful cultural background, and I only want to expand upon it. I deeply desire to understand foreign traditions, and participate actively in other cultures.

  <div class="entry-content">One summer I was taking summer classes at Mines and I rode the bus to school four days a week.  Strange people congregate on the bus sometimes, but mostly it&#8217;s just groggy people trying to pass the time on the way to work / school.  I was one such person.

I woke up one morning as we reached one of the bus stops.  A tall, scraggly man got on the bus, smelling rather strongly.  Backpack in tow and wearing a coat despite the weather combined with his demeanor and the metal cup he was holding out in front of him, I gathered that he was panhandling.  I reached into my pocket and found some change, and proceeded to drop it into his cup, only to find that he was not, in fact, asking for change, but rather just trying to drink his coffee.  Plop plop.

  <div class="entry-content">Not long ago we got our third graphics project assigned.  In the first we wrote our own raytracer, and in the second we got familiar with OpenGL and implemented a trackball interface that would load a model and allow the user to rotate it around to see it from different angles.  This third project deals with texturing, however.

The first part was to generate a torus and texture it with a tile-able pattern (we were given a few wood textures and one brick).  Same trackball interface applies.

[caption id=&#8221;attachment_130&#8221; align=&#8221;alignnone&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;A torus made of bricks&#8221;]<a href="http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/brick_torus.png"><img src="http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/brick_torus-300x282.png" alt="A torus made of bricks" title="Brick Torus" width="300" height="282" class="size-medium wp-image-130" /></a>[/caption]

Next up was to add a way to render a model that&#8217;s seemingly made out of mirror, reflecting a virtual environment, provided to us by a teacher.  This one seems to be the inside of a building near a window.

[caption id=&#8221;attachment_131&#8221; align=&#8221;alignnone&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;Bunny of mirrors&#8221;]<a href="http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/mirror_bunny.png"><img src="http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/mirror_bunny-300x282.png" alt="Bunny of mirrors" title="Mirrored Bunny" width="300" height="282" class="size-medium wp-image-131" /></a>[/caption]

Lastly, given a 3D texture (marble), we were to &#8220;carve&#8221; a model out of that material.  See Isis and the shark made of marble.

  <div class="entry-content">KAUST&#8217;s Provost, Fawwaz Ulaby, started things off with a presentation about KAUST and its facilities, and then there was some time for a Q & A.  Highlights follow.

In Michigan, where Prof. Ulaby currently works, there are three universities that share a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMR_Spectroscopy">NMR</a> machine purchased for them by the state.  Demands for time on this machine are relatively high, and so professors from these schools only get about 30 - 60 minutes on it per month.  KAUST will have 6 such machines.

KAUST&#8217;s per-student investment is US$3 million.

KAUST hired a professor from <a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College</a> to oversee the construction of an electron microscope of the highest caliber.  Apparently, though, as the project is wrapping up, this particular professor was so excited about this machine that he has requested a position at KAUST that he might be able to make use of it.

In January, we will be taken to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to go to a research symposium and check out the campus, etc.  They&#8217;ve apparently reserved something like 80% of the Jeddah Hilton for their students during this week-long event.  We&#8217;ll get a chance to see the campus under construction - that is, to see the more than 30,000 laborers building the 14-square-mile community.  We&#8217;ll also be going camping in the desert - camels and all!

The director of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nih">NIH</a> (an organization that reportedly distributes about US$30 billion per year in grants for medical research), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_Zerhouni">Elias Zerhouni</a> has announced that he&#8217;ll be stepping down as director, and joining KAUST&#8217;s board of directors.  He gave a speech at the event, and is clearly very well-educated and articulate, and I think he will be able to bring a lot to KAUST.

In addition to giving us generous stipends for everything we could need from travel to books to cost of living to new computers, each of us is assigned to an advisor who will reportedly be guiding through the next ~10 months.  This includes advice about which courses to take, but we&#8217;ll also be participating in several developmental exercises aimed at developing the students a little more holistically.  It will focus on things like cultural awareness, time management, etc.  Potentially interesting.

The program looks really fantastic, and the classes so far look pretty interesting.  They said they expect about 60% of their Masters students to continue on to their doctoral program, and this is something in which I&#8217;d be very interested.

  <div class="entry-content">I was building something, and I remembered a friend was saying a while ago that you could tell gcc how many cores to use when building something.  I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s true or not, but it turns out you can certainly tell make:
<code>
make -j(number of cores to use)
</code>

For example,
<code>
make -j2
</code>

I took a screen capture of System Monitor after building each way (make and make -j2), to see the difference.  The first box is using just one core, and the second is using both.

<a href='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/multicore-make.png' title='Multicore Make'><img src='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/multicore-make.thumbnail.png' alt='Multicore Make' /></a>

I had initially thought I&#8217;d have to tell gcc, and so I had planned to edit the makefile to automatically find the number of cores on the system, and then run gcc with that as an argument, so I went in search of how to find the number of cores on a Linux system.  It turns out the easiest way to get that number that I came across was to use /proc/cpuinfo:
<code>
cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep 'cpu cores' | head -1 | sed -r 's/^.+([[:digit:]]+)/1/'
</code>

  <div class="entry-content">Matt Matteson had a homework problem dealing with (n+a)^b, and finding a bound for it.  Expanding this and evaluating it at n=a piqued my curiosity about the sum of each of the binomial expansion terms.  That is to say, the sum of bC0 + bC1 + &#8230; + bCb.

  <div class="entry-content">I recently told my grandmother and cousin-in-law, Wess, about RSS feeds, and both of them said they had been wanting something like RSS for a long time.  I told them a little bit about how it&#8217;s implemented and what is means, but I wanted to put a quick-and-dirty guide to your introduction to RSS.

RSS stands for &#8220;really simple syndication,&#8221; and it&#8217;s a list of current items on a website.  When new items are added to said website, the RSS feed, as it&#8217;s called, gets updated with the new information.  Since you need a client to really make use of your various feeds, it can keep track of which items you have seen and which you have not, and advises you as such.  In this way, you can keep track of the current content on a multitude of websites without visiting each explicitly - the news comes to you.

First you&#8217;ll need a client.  For Mac, I&#8217;d recommend NetNewsWire, which you use in conjunction with your NewsGator account.  NewsGator actually has an online client that is synchronized to your desktop client, and it&#8217;s pretty useful for when I&#8217;m not on my personal machine.  For Windows, About.com has compiled a list of their <a href="http://email.about.com/od/rssreaderswin/tp/top_rss_windows.htm">top 10 clients</a>.

From there, you&#8217;ll make the rounds to your favorite websites and look around until you see the RSS feed logo, <a href='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/newrssxmlfeediconri2.png' title='RSS Feed Icon'><img src='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/newrssxmlfeediconri2.thumbnail.png' alt='RSS Feed Icon' width="16" height="16"/></a> or the words &#8220;RSS Feed.&#8221;  When you click on it, you&#8217;ll be taken to a URL that is the feed itself.  You want to add this URL to your client by adding a new subscription, and copying and pasting.  For example, the feed on my website is <a href="http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/feed/">http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/feed/</a>.

Once you&#8217;ve added all of your most-visited sites, you can begin using your client as you would say, an email client - reading all the new items as they&#8217;re delivered to you.

That, essentially, is the long and the short of it.  If I&#8217;ve left out points or there&#8217;s something you think I should add, I&#8217;d encourage some discussion in the comments.
