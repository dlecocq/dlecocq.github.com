  <div class="entry-content">After tossing and turning in bed for what turned out to be three hours of not being able to sleep, I decided to get on my computer and get some reading done.  Seriously, my RSS client&#8217;s inbox has been around 700 for a couple of days now.  Sure, I just clicked &#8220;mark as read&#8221; for a lot of it, but I did get through a serious chunk:

<a href='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/picture-9.png' title='No New Items'><img src='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/picture-9.thumbnail.png' alt='No New Items' /></a>

I remember that around 1 o&#8217;clock, I listened to Elliott Smith&#8217;s &#8220;2:45 AM&#8221; and hoped it wouldn&#8217;t come to that.

Tips for getting to sleep?  Leave &#8216;em in the comments.  No meds though.  I kicked my Ambien habit.

  <div class="entry-content">This summer I submitted my application for the Discovery Scholarship at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia.  It would pay for my last year of school here, cost of living, travel, tuition there, and a stipend to buy a new laptop.  Well, when you have the fifth largest endowment in the world, I guess you can afford to do that sort of thing.

At any rate, I nit-picked an <a href='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/kaust-essay.pdf' title='Essay'>essay</a> (they wanted an essay of 50 lines or less detailing academic achievement, international experience, statement of purpose, etc., so it&#8217;s bound to be a paced a certain way), and got letters of recommendation from three of my professors.  Specifically, Graeme Fairweather, the department head, Mike Colagrosso, a recently tenured professor who just left us for the private sector (you&#8217;ll be missed, Mike), and Yong Bakos, a first year professor.  All in all, I felt pretty good about my application.

Well, earlier this week I got an email saying that I had been selected as a finalist.  Of the 2300 who applied, they whittled it down to 672 students (of whom they&#8217;re saying they&#8217;ll accept 500); 99 of these are from the US or Canada.  Making it to the finals means that they&#8217;re going to fly me out to Washington D.C. for an interview this weekend, about which I&#8217;m very excited.  I&#8217;ve never been back east, and it will give me a chance to see my cousin Elizabeth and her husband Wess, who live in Arlington, VA.  The KAUST people even let me delay my departure so I could spend Labor Day weekend with them.  Hooray!

At a recent dinner, my mother mentioned that she was praying I didn&#8217;t get accepted.  Something about the perceived danger of living in the Middle East for two years.  At any rate, things are looking up, and at the very least, I&#8217;ll get a trip to D.C. out of it.

It really looks like a beautiful campus and a unique opportunity.  I would be in their first graduating class, getting my Master&#8217;s when I finish.  I have a knack for being in the early graduating classes for schools.  I was in the second class out of my middle school, and I was in the second class to graduate from the IB program at Niwot.

  <div class="entry-content">I very much enjoyed this edition of Woot&#8217;s 10 Things: <a href="http://www.woot.com/Blog/ViewEntry.aspx?Id=5722">10 Things to Look for at Olympic Closing Ceremony</a>.

  <div class="entry-content">For those of us familiar with SQL, we&#8217;re almost certainly familiar with SQL injection attacks.  We&#8217;ve talked about them in class, and maybe the more nefarious of us has even tried it on a form or two.  There are vulnerable ones out there - I remember having to tell an experienced programmer about sanitizing his form input.  If you&#8217;re reading this, you know who you are.

For those of you who don&#8217;t know about SQL injection attacks, the long and short of it is you try to give input in a form that will be interpreted as SQL and executed.  So, for example (see comic link below), you might try to give input that deletes records, or inserts malformed records.  For example, a simple, well-formed request to insert a comment might be:

<code>
INSERT INTO `comments` (`name`, `comment`) VALUES ('Bob', 'My comment');
</code>

If Bob&#8217;s comment has a quote in it, though, if you haven&#8217;t sanitized the input, you&#8217;ll get something that doesn&#8217;t make any sense to the interpreter:

<code>
INSERT INTO `comments` (`name`, `comment`) VALUES ('Bob', 'It's my comment');
</code>

Say Bob were feeling malicious, part of his comment could be an entirely new command that the interpreter would deem valid.  If his comment were &#8220;Haha suckers!&#8217;); DROP TABLE `comments`;&#8221;, then we&#8217;d get two well-formed commands that would get executed:

<code>
INSERT INTO `comments` (`name`, `comment`) VALUES ('Bob', 'Haha suckers!'); DROP TABLE `comments`;');
</code>

This, as you can imagine, is not desirable.  So, part of sanitizing input is to escape out characters that are normally recognized by the interpreter:

<code>
INSERT INTO `comments` (`name`, `comment`) VALUES ('Bob', 'Haha suckers!<strong>'</strong>); DROP TABLE `comments`;');
</code>

At any rate, a few months ago, I actually had an attempt more or less &#8216;caught on tape&#8217; in the comments section of my blog.  I got an email that there was a new comment awaiting moderation, and it was this:

<code>
Bill164415140′,’311521868billy@msn.com’,”,’30.68.179.4′,’2008-03-12 16:12:16′,’2008-03-12 16:12:16′,”,’0′,’lynx’,'comment’,'0′,’0′),(’0′, ”, ”, ”, ”, ‘2008-03-13 16:12:16′, ‘2008-03-13 16:12:16′, ”, ’spam’, ”, ‘comment’, ‘0′,’0′ )
</code>

Not exactly the most harmful stuff.  Still, it was nice to see an attempt in the wild.

Another good example is <a href="http://xkcd.com/327/">this xkcd comic</a>.

  <div class="entry-content">During my time in Japan, I picked up a new habit - smoking.  I would let myself have on cigarette per day, and I would save it until the evening.  I would sit out on my tanning chair with a cigarette, a Kurt Vonnegut book and &#8220;Cafe au lait,&#8221; and just enjoy the quiet Japanese evening.  The crackling of the cigarette and slowly burning ember are among the things I enjoyed most.  As I write this, even, I&#8217;m enjoying a clove cigarette.  I just accidentally ashed on the floor.  Oops.  Apparently for the crackling of cigarettes in movies, they use cloves because they&#8217;re so much louder.  A film-major friend of mine said that the mics can&#8217;t pick up that of a normal cigarette.  Clove smoke is so much thicker, too.  It rises up like a beautiful plume.  The taste is toxic.  Somehow I&#8217;ve always found it satisfying.  It&#8217;s like breathing poison.  Fill my lungs.

  <div class="entry-content">Tonight I saw Shireen, and in fact, it&#8217;s just now that I&#8217;m returning.  I&#8217;m so completely infatuated with her, and we&#8217;ve spent many nights in the last couple of weeks cuddling and kissing softly.  She told me tonight that kissing me is like Chocolate Milk - warm, sweet, and makes her feel tingly.  She&#8217;s so sweet.

I told her that kissing her fills me with pride and awe and makes me feel very flattered that such a wonderful girl and beautiful creature would kiss me.

A few weeks ago I told her that I had a crush on her.  I actually told her twice - the first time when more than a little drunk, and the next night I told her as I had intended.  A couple days afterwards, she informed me that she liked me, as well.  I paused, and apparently looked expressionless for a few seconds, which lead her to briefly think that she had said something wrong, but then I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m ecstatic!  This really makes my night.&#8221;  I had just walked her to her car, and she about to be on her way home.  I wished her a good night, and walked off, but even then I wish I had kissed her.  She was already seated in her car, so it probably would have been awkward, but all the same, it just would have been the perfect flourish to wonderful news.

Since, we&#8217;ve spent probably 7 of 9 evenings together, holding each other, watching movies, and just generally twitterpated.  What a lovely girl.

  <div class="entry-content">I was reading about <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/algogeeks">Algorithm Geeks</a>, a Google Group dedicated to algorithm-related questions apparently.  I looked at one of the topics, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/algogeeks/web/unique-elements-in-an-array">Unique Elements in an Array</a>, wondering what the chatter looked like.

To remove duplicate elements of an array, the best way I know is to sort your array, and then do a linear traversal, comparing each to its successor, and when they match, deleting the one of them.  Quicksort is generally the algorithm-of-choice in large part because of its simplicity, but someone on this thread suggested <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort">heapsort</a> - an algorithm of which I had never heard.  I looked it over, and was drawn to the article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap">heaps</a>.  On that page, I was looking at an analysis of the time complexity for building the heap, and I got curious about the summation they present (h/2^h).  So, I took some time and proved its convergence:

  <div class="entry-content">A little over a month ago, I walked into to my brand new job - an internship at ReadyTalk.  Down a corridor, and there&#8217;s a wall covered with dry-erase boards, with the phrase &#8220;Bad-Code-Free Zone.&#8221;  At first, I thought this was meant to be a sort of inspirational semi-strict policy / challenge to / for developers until about a week later, a jokester erased to the &#8220;Bad,&#8221; leaving us all to imagine a &#8220;Code-Free Zone.&#8221;

A few days later, a &#8220;C&#8221; disappeared, leaving us without odes of any kind - &#8220;ode-Free Zone.&#8221;

Days later, &#8220;Diode-Free Zone,&#8221; with the accompanying symbol for a diode with a large &#8220;NO!&#8221; written next to it.  Now, as I get up to go to the bathroom, I&#8217;m left thinking about a &#8220;Lymph Node-Free Zone.&#8221;

You know, I never much cared for lymph.

  <div class="entry-content">I just caught up on the Doctor Who I had missed in the last couple of weeks, and I am just continually impressed at how wrapped up in it I can get.  Seriously, it&#8217;s so incredibly fantastic.

I realize that watching it makes me kind of a nerd (not that I needed any help in that department), but it just gets me so involved each episode.  Twists, turns, adventure and cleverness, I can&#8217;t get over how much I enjoy it.

  <div class="entry-content">&#8220;You must be sophomores or juniors,&#8221; began a man sporting a cowboy hat and giant backpack.  A sign strapped to his pack read, &#8220;Montana Old Vet.&#8221;  He was speaking to a couple of girls who were sitting behind me on the bus.

&#8220;Or at least approaching the junior&#8230; approach,&#8221; he said with surprising deliberateness.  One was a junior in college and the other was a recent graduate.  &#8220;Congratulations.&#8221;

&#8220;The thing about life&#8230; There&#8217;s one thing you have to understand about life, and that&#8217;s the difference between the subjective and the objective.&#8221;  At this point, I was expecting some mild old-man crazy, but I always get hopeful that an elder will have something real and useful to tell me.  &#8220;If you understand that, you&#8217;re set.&#8221;

The girls, you could tell, were going to politely engage the man without trying to encourage him.  They spoke a little while longer, and he wished them luck in their future endeavors.  &#8220;The things about life,&#8221; he began again.  Over the course of the <del datetime="2008-05-30T00:16:01+00:00">conversation</del> lecture, he would tell this &#8220;thing about life&#8221; several times.  &#8220;You have to understand the difference between the subjective and the objective.&#8221;

He mentioned that he had been through the ropes &#8220;several times&#8221; over the course of his 59 years.  He fought in the war, and made it clear that his three primary pursuits were fishing, beer and women.  &#8220;You two are the most beautiful women I&#8217;ve ever talked to.&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s very flattering.&#8221;
&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean to flatter anyone.&#8221;
&#8220;Do you know the difference between subjective and objective?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, I think so.&#8221;
&#8220;Well?&#8221;
&#8220;The objective is, like, truth, and the subjective is like, feeling.&#8221;
&#8220;That&#8217;s why a professor will tell you to shut your fucking mouth.  I don&#8217;t mean to insult you.&#8221;
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you tell us so we don&#8217;t get it wrong.&#8221;
&#8220;God damn! Do I have to be the professor?&#8221;

He held out his pinky and began to explain that the objective was what you saw, and the subjective was what you felt, tasted, heard and smelled.  &#8220;The thing about life is, it&#8217;s not a penis or a vagina, it&#8217;s you have to know the difference between the subjective and the objective.&#8221;

He told the girls about how he&#8217;d given away all of his money, and that it was important to understand the function of money and economics.  When one of the girls mentioned she was going to go into law, he seemed to have a lot to say on the subject.

&#8220;You&#8217;re going to have defendants, and you gotta give the other guy hell.  Are you smart enough to be a lawyer?  Do you think you&#8217;re smart enough?  You got to treat the judge with respect.  Do you outsmart the guys?&#8221;

He talked about how he was going up to Montana to see his grandkids, and hunt and fish and tell stories.  One of the girls asked that he eat some elk for her as she hadn&#8217;t had a chance in a while.  &#8220;Do you hunt?&#8221;

&#8220;No, but my uncle does.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, do you love him?  You gonna marry him?  You got to learn to hunt for yourself!&#8221;

He mentioned the war again, &#8220;I can tell you about any weapon&#8230; at the time.  I once shot something from 288 yards.  You know how I know?  I walked there after.  It took me two and a half hours.&#8221;

&#8220;What did you shoot?  A deer?  An elk?&#8221;

After a pause of several minutes he told her it was a Vietcong Lieutenant Colonel.  &#8220;I sometimes think about this finger, about chopping it off because of it.  I got to live with it.  Those were my orders, and you gotta follow &#8216;em.  I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s an excuse.  The thing about life is&#8230;&#8221;

As far as crazy people go, pretty mild, but you never find crazy like bus-crazy.
