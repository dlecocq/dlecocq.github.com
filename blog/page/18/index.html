  <div class="entry-content">A friend of mine (Andrew Ferguson) posted some <a href="http://andrewferguson.net/2008/05/14/top-5-reasons-it-sucks-to-be-an-engineering-student/">reasons</a> he thought it sucked to be an engineering student.

Yes, sometimes it&#8217;s difficult, but I think we often have a head start on our counterparts in a lot of ways by engineering.

Some of my favorite professors have been from computer science.  Granted, that <em>is</em> what I study, but even from high school, many of my favorites were in math / science.  My high school calculus teacher motivated me very much, and would spend hours with me after school talking about various proof-projects we had going on (yes, I&#8217;m apparently <em>that</em> kid).

Textbooks can be rough, I&#8217;ll give him that, but I think that&#8217;s in large part symptomatic of the information engineering textbooks must contain.  They have to catalog a lot of things, and for my money, I think they generally do a pretty reasonable job.

While other disciplines may have inflated grades, I haven&#8217;t been denied opportunities because of my grades.  I don&#8217;t have quite the GPA I&#8217;d like, but people know how difficult sciences are and appreciate it when considering you for positions.

Sometime the beatings the assignments put us through do tend to blend together; I don&#8217;t know about Andrew&#8217;s coursework, but this semester I&#8217;ve had some of the most exhilarating assignments I&#8217;ve ever had.  We wrote our own shell, we downloaded and parsed RSS feeds using only shell (unfortunately not our own).  For Scientific Computing, I admit there was a lot of work, but they were assignments that kept me up at night, out of pure curiosity.

This doesn&#8217;t even include the job market situation.  Other engineering disciplines don&#8217;t feature the growth that computer science has seen in recent years, I admit, but Mines certainly has fantastic job placement.  Of my closest high school friends, I have two in international relations, three in linguistics, one in liberal arts, and one in chemical engineering.  The engineers enjoy the jealousy of the others with respect to the prospect of work.

All things considered, I&#8217;ve really my collegiate career up to this point, and I imagine I will continue to.

  <div class="entry-content">Two days ago I finished my final for Scientific Computing (it was a take-home final), and was somewhat sad to see the end of it.  Sure, it was a lot of work (too much, according to Matt Matteson) - I spent literally upwards of a hundred hours this semester working on the homework and exams.  I recently tallied up the number of pages I submitted, and it was upwards of a 135 8.5 x 11 pages, most of it marked up in LaTeX.  (Because of this class my LaTeX-fu has grown significantly stronger.)

I look forward to any more classes I have with this prof.

  <div class="entry-content">For various reasons, two weeks ago, I feel a week behind in schoolwork.  I have worked harder than I&#8217;ve ever worked for school, caught up, and I&#8217;m now almost finished with finals - just one more to go.  A couple days after that, I&#8217;ll be starting my internship at ReadyTalk, and so the summer is starting to kick off more or less.

The 15th sees my friends and me moving into a place for a summer that promises to be filled with hanging out, organically grown food (Alan works on an organic farm), and wine.

  <div class="entry-content">In my OS class, we&#8217;ve started talking about some page-replacement algorithms, including FIFO, LRU, and clock.  These are going to be on an upcoming exam, and so Mike (our prof) suggested that we make up our own page access sequences, and then run the algorithm.  That&#8217;s all well and good, but without knowing whether or not you got it right, problems might arise.

Enter Ruby - make a quick little script that will run the algorithm for you, so as to check your results.

<a href='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/fifo.rb' title='First-in First-out'>fifo.rb</a>
<a href='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/lru.rb' title='Least-Recently-Used'>lru.rb</a>

Usage:
<code>
fifo.rb "123412512345" 3 # Run the sequence provided with a queue size of 3
lru.rb "293847101928" 5 # Run the provided sequence with a stack size of 5
</code>

All the page numbers do have to be single characters, but letters and symbols are also accepted.

Sample output:
<code>
Dan-Lecocqs-Mac:Desktop dlecocq$ ./lru.rb "123412512345" 4
1 * 1
2 * 2	1
3 * 3	2	1
4 * 4	3	2	1
1   1	4	3	2
2   2	1	4	3
5 * 5	2	1	4
1   1	5	2	4
2   2	1	5	4
3 * 3	2	1	5
4 * 4	3	2	1
5 * 5	4	3	2
Page faults: 8 / 12
</code>

Please note that you&#8217;ll have to change your shebang line to point to the path of your Ruby interpreter.  I found Ruby in lots of places on my system, but check in your path.  (Note: I&#8217;m using Ruby 1.8.4, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m using a lot, or any, recent-version specific functionality)

If you&#8217;re not running it with &#8220;ruby fifo.rb &#8230;&#8221;, make sure you&#8217;ve chmod&#8217;d it to be executable.

  <div class="entry-content">One of my favorite things is when websites show me this when I register:

<a href='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/picture-3.png' title='I hate security'><img src='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/picture-3.png' alt='I hate security' /></a>

It&#8217;s almost as if they&#8217;re saying - &#8220;we hate strong passwords.&#8221;  And it makes me trust even more that they&#8217;re actually hashing it in their database.

  <div class="entry-content">If you&#8217;re a <a href="http://growl.info">Growl</a> user, you probably appreciate (or are annoyed by) being able to get updates from various applications in a relatively out-of-the-way fashion.

There is a command line utility included with Growl called growlnotify.  It allows you to send up your own alerts from your own code (say using exec(3) or in your shell scripts), but it&#8217;s nice to use for other things, too.  If I have a command that&#8217;s conceivably going to take a while, I tack on a && and growlnotify.  Just like some people use

<code>make && ./myapp</code>

when they run their code to ensure it&#8217;s running the latest saved version, it&#8217;s a nice way to get a heads-up instead of waiting a few minutes for that god-awful command to run.  For example, recently I was using curl(1) to get a bunch of files off of a server (when I fall behind on a webcomic, it&#8217;s just easier to download a bunch of them and browse them quickly in Preview instead of clicking through each), and it ended up taking a good 10 minutes:

<code>curl http://boasas.com/boasas/[1-940].gif -o "#1.gif" && growlnotify --message "I'm done downloading" --title "curl"</code>

I get back to reading my dailies, and by the time I&#8217;ve forgotten that I set it going, up pops a nice little notification:

<a href='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/picture-1.png' title='Growlnotify'><img src='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/picture-1.thumbnail.png' alt='Growlnotify' /></a>

I will note that it can be a little finnicky.  It generally has better success when no title is supplied, and if you&#8217;re going to be running it with &&, I might suggest making it a 

<code>mycommand && echo $? && growlnotify --message "my message" --title "mycommand"</code>

Since it gets its message argument from standard in, you can also pipe to it if your command returns a value of which you&#8217;d like to be notified:

<code>make ; if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then echo "Success"; else echo "Failure"; fi | growlnotify --title "make"</code>

<a href='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/picture-2.png' title='Growlnotify Make'><img src='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/picture-2.thumbnail.png' alt='Growlnotify Make' /></a>

  <div class="entry-content">A couple of weeks ago, I read about Charles Barber&#8217;s new book, <em>Comfortably Numb</em> in <a href="http://www.wired.com/culture/culturereviews/magazine/16-02/pl_print">Wired</a>, and it sounded intensely interesting.  It&#8217;s due to come out this month, and I&#8217;ve reserved one of the first copies to come into Golden Public Library.

At any rate, I decided to pursue his other book, <em>Songs From The Black Chair</em>.  Honestly, when I found (in the prologue) that this was a reference to Tears For Fear&#8217;s <em>Songs From The Big Chair</em>, I was turned off, but perhaps in the end it was relatively appropriate.  Still, I felt like it was a stretch.

In terms of the meat of the book, rarely in my &#8220;adult life&#8221; have I been so floored by a book.  I got the book last week, and read the prologue on Thursday night, but finished the rest of it on Sunday and today.  When class let out this afternoon, I wasn&#8217;t thinking of coming home, having a beer and watching a TV show before starting homework.  Instead, I was set on finishing up the home stretch of this book.  The last time I read a book so quickly (for me, this is very fast) was Kurt Vonnegut&#8217;s <em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em>.  (I reread it for a scholarship essay I wrote; incidentally, I didn&#8217;t win the moneys.)

Reading this book was like reading about my friend and myself.  At first, to the point that I felt completely and utterly involved, and then so much that it was eerie, and then at last to the point that I almost felt indignant about being very eloquently how I felt.  I can&#8217;t very well articulate how much its reading has affected me.

Oddly enough, at certain points it made me give more credence to the whole anarchist nihilistic punk thing - a &#8220;thing&#8221; I always regarded as, well, silly.  That&#8217;s certainly not to say I don&#8217;t love Fight Club or SLC Punk, but like Stevo said, he had given no thought to the future, and when the world didn&#8217;t end, he had to grow up.

  <div class="entry-content">&#8220;This is it, Joel,&#8221; Clementine said.  &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be gone soon.&#8221;
&#8220;I know.&#8221;
&#8220;What do we do?&#8221;
&#8220;Enjoy it.  Say good-bye.&#8221;

I want to live in a world that, as it&#8217;s coming to an end, people aren&#8217;t running naked into the streets to get laid one last time, but are going to the beach and flying an airplane.  Making shy conversation with that girl you saw from a distance.

The soundtrack is so moving, the cinematography so effective and the direction captures so well what it&#8217;s like to be dreaming.  It&#8217;s all the excitement of infatuation and spending so much time with someone you love to the point that you can&#8217;t stand them, without all the crap associated with romantic movies.  Joel only tells Clementine that he loves her once, and it&#8217;s not met with a love-struck gaze and reciprocation, but a caring &#8220;Meet me in Montauk.&#8221;

This is the kind of movie that I watch in my head over and over again as I listen to the soundtrack.  When I watch it, I feel the <em>absence</em>.  It&#8217;s not a sorrow, or happiness but a simple material existence - a mass passively partaking in the universe.  I don&#8217;t have to think, feel, or even perceive, but am just a party to the world - a fly on the wall.

  <div class="entry-content">My first <a href="http://woot.com">woot</a> is just 25 miles away.  I&#8217;ve been keeping my ear to the ground with their RSS feed for the last year or so (and seen a few woot-worthy - though, unfortunately they only ship to the States), but this is my first wooting.  What is my first woot?  A toy I don&#8217;t need, but I hope to have fun with - <a href="http://www.roboquadonline.com/">Roboquad</a>.

Take a look at some of the videos you can find <a href="http://youtube.com/results?search_query=roboquad&search=Search">around</a> the <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=roboquad">interwebs</a>.

Incidentally, within a week, I&#8217;ve made my second wooting - this time a Roomba Discovery for my parents for Christmas.  Shh - don&#8217;t tell them.

<strong>Update:</strong> My woot is on my doorstep. (<strong>10:08 11/16/07</strong>)
