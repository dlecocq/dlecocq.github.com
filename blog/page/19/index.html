  <div class="entry-content">I just ran into one of Leopard&#8217;s &#8220;more than 300 new features.&#8221;  I was wanting to move a plugin into an app&#8217;s plugin directory, but was told that I could not move it, as the directory was protected.  I guess I&#8217;d just have to click Canc&#8230; wait.  There&#8217;s another button off in the distance (well, right next to it).  &#8220;Authenticate&#8221;?  Let&#8217;s give that a go.  It prompts me for a username and password, I fill them in and the magic happens.  This is so awesome because it saves me from having to go into Terminal and sudo the command.

In celebration, enjoy xkcd&#8217;s remarks on <a href="http://xkcd.com/149/">sudo</a>.

  <div class="entry-content">My younger sister is in her high school&#8217;s production of Elton John and Tim Rice&#8217;s Aida.  For someone who doesn&#8217;t like theater as a medium, plays as a literary work, and holds a special loathing for scholastic performances like this, I was very impressed.

The plot was obvious, the writing tedious and seriously, who likes the musical numbers?  But the singing (save the male lead) was incredible - it was hard to believe these voices were coming from high schoolers.  The choreography was spectacular and the production value was unlike any other school production I&#8217;ve ever seen.  The set was very complete and the costumes weren&#8217;t the get-your-mom-to-stitch-scraps-together attire I was expecting, but rather, stylish, neat and even provocotive.

As the forbidden love crescendos with the romantic leads sharing a kiss to fading lights, I was filled more than ever with cynicism.  When the lights came back on and the lovers were still lip-locked, I felt the entirely unexpected hope that the two actors were, themselves, in love.  I am still frustrated at being so taken with this medium I loathe so much.

I always thought that choir teachers and conductors were always trying to trick their audience (mostly parents and siblings - at least half of whom don&#8217;t want to be there) into getting emotionally caught up in the performance.  If you were sappy enough to, they had won.

All in all, I can&#8217;t deny that tonight I bought into the cheese.  I longed to be Aida&#8217;s forbidden love, and wished the heros well.  But at least this cynic can find a very small consolation in the fact [SPOILER] that the lovers die in the end - buried alive for traitorous transgresions.  Ah, l&#8217;amour.

  <div class="entry-content">Thanks to Wells Fargo&#8217;s promotion whereby opening a &#8220;College Combo&#8221; account with them gives the customer a voucher for 2 season passes for the price of one, I got my first season pass.  I didn&#8217;t know anyone who would want a pass, and so I put an ad on Facebook and found someone almost immediately, and yesterday we went down to Christy Sports and bought our passes.  I look forward to my first season in Colorado - if you want to go to Copper Mountain, Winter Park or Mary Jane, give me an email!

  <div class="entry-content">Boulder is its own kind of place.  That&#8217;s not to say I don&#8217;t like it - there are certainly things to like about it, but its high pedestrian and bicyclist population makes me paranoid whenever I drive there.

By all means pedestrians should have the right of way in city limits on the road, but people in Boulder tend to bolt out onto the street with complete disregard for traffic.  Ack.

At any rate, I was reading on Wired about Virgin rating the <a href="http://blog.wired.com/cars/2007/11/where-are-the-m.html">11 most bike-friendly cities in the world</a>, and I felt a hint of a tinge of pride at the fact that Boulder, CO appeared fourth on the list.  Go hippies.

  <div class="entry-content">I am actually writing this post from my Nintendo DS.  Though I originally got the DS to use with a Kanji dictionary cartridge, since I had it laying around, I thought I&#8217;d drop the $30 to let me surf the net with it.  That said, I had heard mixed reviews about the Opera web browser for DS, but most complaints were from people looking to play Flash games on the &#8216;net or people expecting Firefox on something like this.

Although it doesn&#8217;t boast the fastest browsing around, I&#8217;m liking it very much so far.  Late nights in bed trying to recall the details of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm can be settled earlier with a bedside visit to Wikipedia from my new toy.  I envision myself taking this places where I don&#8217;t want to lug around a laptop (read: coffee shops), but I may have to look something up on Google or Wikipedia to verify a friendly bet.

It is, however, a little cumbersome to write a post or e-mail like this.

Addendum:
I thought it might be useful to show some sites with which I&#8217;ve had success, and which ones flounder.

Facebook - yes; little finnicky
Gmail - yes; no hitches
Google Reader - not yet; trying to tweak
Meebo - no; definite no
Lifehacker - yes; looks good, too
Wired - yes; slow to open, though
Google Search - yes
Google Maps - no :-(
Instructables - no
Yahoo Maps - yes; I miss Google

Still, I do get a certain amount of pride from the education level of Colorado, and especially the Boulder area.  Culture is just dripping from every hemp messenger bag and Birkenstock sandal in Boulder proper.

  <div class="entry-content">Wüt for Leopard.

I&#8217;ve been enjoying the hell out of Apple&#8217;s new OS - you can read about its awesomeness elsewhere.  I will express my surprise, however, that they are using a picture of <a href="http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2007/10/leopard-bsod-ic.html">Windows&#8217; BSOD</a> as the icon for network PCs.  So&#8230; smug.  I hope people are laughing about this as much as I am.

I was wary of the semi-transparent top bar, but the only thing I didn&#8217;t like about it was Google Notifier&#8217;s icon indicating that I have no unread mail.  It&#8230; used&#8230; white&#8230;, not&#8230; transparent.  I think you&#8217;ll agree it looked awful:

<a href='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/before.png' title='Before'><img src='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/before.png' alt='Before' /></a>

Much better after deleting the white bits and making them transparent:

  <div class="entry-content">At the supermarket, middle-aged folks with nothing planned for the evening will take a glance at the $9.99 rack of movies just to see if anything pops out at them.  Middle-aged folks.

More and more the movies that are on those racks are some of my favorites: Trainspotting, Amélie, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown&#8230;  So, when did I become the target market?  In some ways it&#8217;s nice that products I want are being marketed towards me, or rather that there&#8217;s more of a market for things that I want, but I still find it quietly discouraging.

1. Place cigar/cigarette in mouth, ignite.

4. Swing away.

Either way, I&#8217;ve decided to party up this October 31st nerdy-style.  Gonna find / make myself some steampunk goggles and pick up a lab coat.  I&#8217;ve been <a href="http://www.evilmadscientist.com/article.php/LEDMinifigs">carving up LEGO mans</a> and ordered a couple of bags of LEDs for them.
