  <div class="entry-content">As I <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/launch/-303315.php">read today</a>, Amazon is selling DRM-free music for 89 to 99 cents.  As much as I love Apple and want it to bear my children, DRM irks me in so many ways; though they&#8217;ve begun selling DRM-free music for $1.29 (since May), whenever I find myself looking for music on iTunes, none of it is ever available for as such.  And even then, I think I&#8217;d find it hard to man up the extra 30 cents per song.

I appreciate that it&#8217;s probably not Apple&#8217;s choice or &#8220;fault,&#8221; and it&#8217;s a product of some record companies wanting a little bit of an extra &#8220;guarantee&#8221; (though it&#8217;s hardly anything at all - try googling &#8220;break apple drm&#8221;).  Still, it&#8217;s sad.  I mean, you go and buy the physical CD, and you can do whatever you&#8217;d ever want to with it pretty easily.

In celebration of Amazon&#8217;s new feature, I decided to buy Feist&#8217;s &#8220;1234.&#8221;  Ironically featured in the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/ads/">TV spot</a> for the new (and impressive) iPod nano.

  <div class="entry-content">My XBox is now my gateway to my media.  $4.73 for Splinter Cell (how this particular hack gets the Linux installer running), and $21.81 for an Action Replay kit to transfer the files. Now, all the media on the LAN are at the fingertips of my XBox.  Music, Pictures, Movies and TV Shows - the whole gambit.

I used <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/geek-to-live/transform-your-classic-xbox-into-a-killer-media-center-299809.php">this Lifehacker article</a> as a guideline.  All in all, it took about an hour.

  <div class="entry-content">I&#8217;ve been wanting to make myself a nice little iPod case out of a book.  Until now, I had been waiting for a sufficiently nerdy book to find its way to me.

I had to go to the Longmont Public Library to get a copy of Slaughterhouse Five (Kurt Vonnegut), and thought I&#8217;d check their used books table.  Nothing quite nerdy enough.  In the basement, however, where they keep all of their free books, I found a book from simpler times: Introduction to Logic.  Old, antiquated (this edition, not logic itself), and just nerdy enough.  I spent about $2.60 on magnets to embed in it so that it would remain closed when jostled, and a little Elmers glue, an razor blade, and a little bit of time, and I&#8217;ve got myself a nice little iPod case.

<a href='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/photo-205.jpg' title='Introduction to Logic'><img style="float:left;margin:5px" src='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/photo-205.thumbnail.jpg' alt='Introduction to Logic' /></a>

The process will invariably have to begin again when I finally decide to go for a next generation iPod, but until then.

  <div class="entry-content">I have been dying to try out <a href="http://mint.com">Mint</a>, but unfortunately it doesn&#8217;t support my local bank at this point.  They recently reworked their setup so that it&#8217;s much faster than it was a couple of days ago, and it looks so incredibly amazing.  What it does is it keeps track of your various credit cards and bank accounts by logging you in and retrieving your recent activity.  I&#8217;m not sure to what extent it automatically sort things, but my understanding is that it will do its best to pick out things like gas and groceries and sort them accordingly.  See the changes in your monthly entertainment spending.  

All in all, it looks very sharp.  I emailed them about adding support for my bank, and hopefully they will do so soon.

  <div class="entry-content">Colin told me about laser microphones, and the idea tickled me in a way that most times I&#8217;m tickled like that, I have to cuddle afterwards.

At any rate, I happened upon a <a href="http://www.metacafe.com/watch/767822/laser_espionage_microphone_how_to/">metacafe video</a> of how to make one yourself.  I skipped down to Radioshack and bought the photoresistor and a cheap laser pointer.

I had some troubles getting any signal off of it at first, but I decided to try to set it up like I thought it should work and try the whole shebang without trying to get each piece to work.  I was able to pick up taps on the glass (though they had to be amplified a great deal, giving me a surprisingly clear signal), but I was unable to record any voices.  I expect this just has to do with the intensity and spread of the laser, and I imagine that a higher quality laser might be able to pick up speech.  If I ever get one of the nice <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/lights/657a/">Think Geek laser pointers</a>, I&#8217;ll certainly have to try it again.  I wonder what my neighbors have to say.

  <div class="entry-content">Here are another couple of little blurbs I wrote for another scholarship.

1) <strong>What would you do if you weren&#8217;t afraid?</strong>

If I weren’t afraid, I would actually do very little worthwhile.  For me, fear is an enormous motivating factor - from driving me to be more competitive to encouraging me to accomplish more.  Somewhat ironically, if often pushes me to do things of which I am tremendously afraid - the fear of not doing it outweighing the fear of the deed itself.

Many things worth doing are pretty frightening - from skydiving to going down that ski run that makes you wet yourself; and still other things are worth doing exclusively for the fear they engender.  It helps me learn things about myself: how do I act under the pressure?  Do I have the stones to take the jump?  What’s worthwhile enough for me to do that for?

Being afraid of losing my edge or not besting competitors and colleagues or not self-actualizing lights a little fire under me to accomplish.  A fear of not getting to do what I want to eggs me on.  It all generates a competitive attitude that benefits me in a big big way.  Even evolutionarily, fear can help us to perform.

Besides, very few things beat the rush of being scared out of your gourd as you speed almost uncontrollably down the mountain.

2) <strong>How are you going to change the world?</strong>

My biggest strength as an empiricist and a person and what I hope to bring to those around me is a clear understanding and an appreciation for science.  It’s essentially a formal definition of how we as humans come to understand the world we live in, and everyone should at least foster a minimalist awareness of the basic principles that drive it.

In raising kids, I want them to be very aware of how useful science is in terms of technological advances but also in terms of its efficacy as a methodology in it and of itself.  “Indoctrination” is such an ugly word, but I really do want my children to understand the tremendous importance.  And it’s not just limited to my children - friends, family, co-workers, and I’m totally bringing it to the blogosphere.

I hope that eventually we will live in a world that can take a more rational approach to the problems that face us individually, as families and even as countries.  That’s not by any means saying that I want to do away with things like religion or art, and certainly not wanting to take a completely utilitarian approach to life.  I just think the world would be a much better place if people would appreciate the mechanisms that underly the madness and how we ultimately know and understand them.  Short of curing cancer and AIDS and feeding the hungry, I think it’s one of the most important things in the world today.

  <div class="entry-content">It&#8217;s CSM&#8217;s census day today, which usually means one thing for me: changing classes at the last minute.  Sixteen credits turned into fifteen (I really don&#8217;t want to take Senior Seminar).  I wanted to take Database Management, but the professor left Mines, and the class was cancelled.  Next on to my next choice Compiler Design (I&#8217;ve been wanting this class since I took Principles of Programming Languages, and it&#8217;s only offered once a year.  You get to write your own Java compiler!  How awesome is that?

I would really like to make it out of Mines in a timely fashion, and I&#8217;ll have some graduate school requirements, so&#8230; on to the next really enticing class: CSCI562 Applied Algorithms and Data Structures.  One of my favorite classes was CSCI406 Algorithms, and Dr. Mehta is teaching this one as well.

I hadn&#8217;t turned in my grad school application when it was due, so I was planning on starting my grad work this spring.  As it turns out, there&#8217;s a mechanism for allowing undergrads to take graduate courses.  Unfortunately only seniors are allowed to, and from my first two years at Mines, I had only 88 credits (two credits shy of seniorhood).  My transfer credit from my year abroad hasn&#8217;t come in yet (all up to 12 credits of it).  A signature from the prof of the course, my advisor and the man in charge of grad school, and I&#8217;m in the class!

My first graduate class!  In the of the l337, &#8220;w00t.&#8221;

  <div class="entry-content">His name is Robert Paulson.

Who doesn&#8217;t love Tyler Durden and Fight Club?  In the spirit of the Paper Street Soap Company, Kevin and I decided we would try to make our own soap.

Unfortunately, we didn&#8217;t render human fat, and as Kevin is vegetarian, we had to use vegetable oil.  After doing a little research, we picked some oils, ordered four pounds of lye (NaOH), and got to work.  It&#8217;s apparently a very long process, starting with combining your fats and heating them until the mixture homogenizes, mixing lye into water (never putting water into lye), mixing until &#8220;trace,&#8221; and letting it sit&#8230; for 4-6 weeks.

Our recipe called for 175 grams of lye into about 514 ml of water (~8.5 M).  The highest concentration of NaOH I&#8217;d worked with (in Quant lab) had been only .4 molar, but that wasn&#8217;t so dangerous, so why should 20 times more concentrated do any harm?

Our handywork is sitting in my basement, and over the course of the last few days it has hardened from about liquid soap to a substantially thick paste.  Hopefully when it finishes, we will have usable soap.
