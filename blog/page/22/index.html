  <div class="entry-content">My friends and I almost got beaten with a baseball bat setting dry ice bombs off while in Japan, which just made Alan and me want to do it even more.  <a href='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/sany0002.JPG' title='Alan Throwing'>Alan Throwing</a>

The premise for a dry ice bomb is simple: dry ice sublimes in a closed container and when the pressure is sufficiently high, boom.  We add warm water to speed up the whole process, but still pretty simple.

Safeway sells dry ice (as I understand it, you must be 18 or older to purchase it, but we did not get carded) at a rate of $0.99 per pound in up to 8-pound blocks.  We got ourselves three pounds, and headed home, where we had plenty of bottles, gloves, a hammer, and a couple of airsoft guns waiting for us.

One of the advantages to living in the boonies is that you <em>can</em> set off these explosives and shoot BBs in your back yard.  Although, the neighbors must have wondered what in the hell was going on.

In general, a lot of fun, and relatively safe.  I&#8217;ve had some of these go off in my hands, and while there&#8217;s a bit of a sting, all your fingers are still there.  As long as you&#8217;re not using <a href="http://www.break.com/index/dry_ice_nalgene_explosion.html">a nalgene</a>, other hard plastic, glass, or metal, it&#8217;s pretty benign.  Shooting them is just an added bonus, and beats the hell out of setting out empty cans to hit.  These targets explode.

  <div class="entry-content">I recently put in a 3.5 mm jack in my car stereo that I might listen to my iPod without an FM transmitter (with which I&#8217;ve had no luck) or one of those cassette tapes (my tape deck does not work).  In using my bulky soldering iron which I am certain came from the 50&#8217;s, I soldered two pins together, and I&#8217;m sure I came close to breaking something on several occasions.  Frankly, I&#8217;m surprised the whole thing worked in the end.

I had seen the ColdHeat soldering iron on <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/tools/69d3/">ThinkGeek</a> (my nerd toys site of choice), but found out that RadioShack sells them, too.  (And at RadioShack, it was even the same price!)  Being one who hates to wait for / pay for shipping, and seeing as Kevin and I are going to do the same little experiment on his car stereo this weekend, I hopped on down to RadioShack to get it.  I had some other things on my RS shopping list for other projects that this store didn&#8217;t have, but so be it.

I got it home, turned it on, and overly-trustingly touched the tip.  Nothing.  I touched the tip to the solder, and it melted and a blob fell to the counter.  As soon as I could, I touch the tip again.  Room temperature.  It&#8217;s pretty neat.  Check out some of the videos of it out and about on YouTube and Google Video.

For those interested, I got the car-stereo jack idea from <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/digital-music/add-an-auxiliary-input-to-your-car-stereo-293261.php">Lifehacker</a>, who apparently found it on <a href="http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2007/08/how_to_adding_auxiliary_i.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890">Make</a>.

  <div class="entry-content">This is our first assignment (due this coming Wednesday), and seems relatively appropriate.  I&#8217;ll let <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionaries_and_cannibals_problem">Wikipedia</a> give you background.

I pounded it out in about 10-20 minutes in Ruby, and seems like a good chance for me to refresh my Dr. Scheme (it&#8217;s been about a year, except for a pop quiz from Matt Matteson).  Although it&#8217;s really not a difficult problem to solve nor that much of a feat to code for it, I really enjoy the simplicity of the solution.  It reminded me a lot of a really elegant solution to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi">Tower Of Hanoi</a> problem that Prof. Rader showed us in Data Structures.

Additionally, it&#8217;s always fun to take first steps in a buzz-word-titled class: Artificial Intelligence.

  <div class="entry-content"><a href='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/2007/08/29/bump-key/bump-key/' rel='attachment wp-att-11' title='Bump Key'><img src='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/photo-198.thumbnail.jpg' alt='Bump Key'  style="float:left;margin:5px;" /></a>It is not unlikely that you&#8217;ve run across this technique on the internet (http://www.metacafe.com/tags/bump+key/).  It involves taking a key that fits a given set of locks, and then for each pin, filing down to the lowest pin setting.  Relatively simple, and the process on the whole is something that supposedly any mildly adroit beginner should be able to complete successfully.

Interviews of lock-picking hobby groups are filled with comments about the absurd ease and dull simplicity of this method.  Admittedly, to a certain extent, I was skeptical.

I went to Lowe&#8217;s and bought a set of files (~$5) (the one I was after was axially triangular), and made a copy of key (~$1.50) I had laying around and to whose corresponding lock I had access.  As per a suggestion in one video, I marked with a permanent marker the placement of the pins along the key, and then filed down to the lowest setting at those points, leaving a sawtoothed edge.

Cautiously, I inserted it to the first pin in the lock and tried to remove it.  Down the fourth pin I was able to remove it.  Upon inserting it completely, however, I was stuck.  Opened the lock, removed the pins and slid it out.  I filed down more so that the peaks between the pins were no more than approximately 45º.  Thereafter, I was able to easily slide the key in and out.  While removing the pin, I noticed that on top of the driver pins, there were springs, making me even more incredulous.  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_tumbler_lock)

The first dozen attempts or so on one lock proved unsuccessful, but it was kind of an awkward setup - in order to unlock, the key had to turn counter-clockwise, and holding the key in my left hand was more conducive to turning it clockwise.  I tried instead to lock the lock with the same method, and it worked!  A second time!  After those successes, it was harder to duplicate, but this lead me to believe that it was simply a matter of improving technique at this point.  I moved onto another lock that they fit, and it was able to unlock it repeatedly.

From what I&#8217;ve read, and now from experience, the biggest difficulty is simply applying the proper amount of torque in the key when bumping it.  On all attempts, however, when I released the torque in order to withdraw the key, I could very clearly hear pins being sprung back into position.

It amazes me that these kinds of locks are so vulnerable to so simple an attack.  All in all, it was a fun and revealing experiment, and I encourage people to try it out themselves.

  <div class="entry-content">It&#8217;s that time of year again - overly zealous and naive freshmen and buying books.

One of the biggest things to help me pay for my books has been softcover international editions.  Some of my friends in inferior disciplines (not engineering) say that they can&#8217;t find international editions of their books - it might just be a technical book thing.  At any rate, I recently ordered three of my textbooks from <a href="http://abebooks.com">Abebooks</a>, and spent a total of $137 (shipping included) for three books that the campus book store would have charged me $400+ for.  All this for getting softcover international editions as opposed to U.S. hardcover editions.

The prize of this collection is my Artificial Intelligence book ($90 at the book store) for which I paid the mere pittance of $16 U.S. (including $8 of shipping).

I&#8217;ve done this in the past, and the books are identical, page for page, and word for word.  They even come adorned with a warning that they are not for sale in the United States:

<blockquote>This edition is manufactured in India and is authorized for sale only in India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and the Maldives.  Circulation of this edition outside of these territories is UNAUTHORIZED.</blockquote>

Or the more specific:

<blockquote>RESTRICTED! Not For Sale In The United States.</blockquote>

I can only hope that this is not to squeeze more money out of us.

Oh.  And I suppose I should mention that these books that I bought are all brand-spanking-new.

  <div class="entry-content">I read about <a href="http://shoeboxed.com">Shoeboxed</a> today on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/shopping/organize-your-receipts-at-shoeboxedcom-291543.php">Lifehacker</a>, and have been trying it out.  Up until this point, I really do keep physical receipts in a shoebox or binder (and probably still will) and have been tagging e-mailed receipts as such in Gmail, and then archiving them.  That was all fine and dandy, but it&#8217;s nice to have something that&#8217;s built just for that.  I took all my old Gmail-stored receipts from such various places as Basegear.com and Potion Factory, and it recognized them as receipts without a hitch and found the right amount in the e-mail.  Well-done Shoeboxed.

It reminds me of a service called <a href="http://www.keyfiler.com/">KeyFiler</a> which lets you store your registration keys for software, etc. in a safe, secure and accessible place.

  <div class="entry-content"><a href='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/picture-1.png' title='Quicksilver'><img src='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/picture-1.thumbnail.png' alt='Quicksilver' style="float:left;margin:5px;" /></a>This is the first entry in an indefinitely long series on my enjoyment of Mac.

On a side note, I saw Superbad on Sunday with some friends (from which the name McLovin comes).  It was enjoyable.  I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d watch it again, but it&#8217;s good to see Michael Cera (a.k.a. George Michael Bluth) in more than just Arrested Development.

Quicksilver.  &#8220;A unified, extensible interface for working with applications, contacts, music, and other data.&#8221;  <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/</a>

Similar to Apple&#8217;s built-in Finder (a big improvement over things like &#8220;Find Files Or Folders&#8221;), Quicksilver lets you find your files, applications, contacts, etc.  Just must faster.  The default is to rebuild the index of common items every 10 minutes.  For me, this means an index of all my applications, my contacts, bookmarks, and a couple of other things.

I press ctrl + space, and I am prompted with a box.  Think of this box as a function.  Or if linguistics is your thing, then think of it as SVO (subject - verb - object).  The first thing you&#8217;re looking for is the subject.  For example, I might start typing &#8220;Kev&#8230;&#8221; and by the time I hit the &#8220;v,&#8221; it is showing me my entry in Address book for Kevin J., a friend of mine.  I hit tab, and now it&#8217;s time to select a &#8220;verb&#8221; so to speak.  

As an Address Book entry, Kevin has a lot of associated actions.  I can email him, edit his contact information, show his vCard, start chatting with him (if he&#8217;s online), and others.  In this case, I want to e-mail him, so I&#8217;ll start typing &#8220;comp&#8230;&#8221;, meaning &#8220;Compose Email.&#8221;  Likewise, I could have typed &#8220;email&#8221; or any substring of the phrase &#8220;compose email.&#8221;  In fact, &#8220;opse&#8221; as in &#8220;cOmPoSE email&#8221; would have also given me this option.  (This is great for when you&#8217;re typing quickly and make errors or for similarly named applications.  I type &#8220;Photo&#8230;&#8221; for &#8220;PHOTOshop&#8221;, but &#8220;Phobo&#8230;&#8221; for &#8220;PHOtoBOoth.&#8221;)

A tap of the enter key and I&#8217;m writing an e-mail to Kevin in Apple Mail.  For someone who hates switching between mouse and keyboard as much as I do, this is a Godsend.  At this point, I&#8217;ve typed:
<ul>
	<li>ctrl+space (2)</li>
	<li>&#8220;kev&#8221; (3)</li>
	<li>tab (1)</li>
	<li>&#8220;comp&#8221; (4)</li>
	<li>enter (1)</li>
</ul>

This is for a grand total of 11 (unless I&#8217;ve miscounted) keystrokes to send an email to my friend Kevin.  Depending on the name of the person you&#8217;re emailing, this is pretty standard.  Emailing anyone I know is 11 keystrokes away from <em>anything I&#8217;m doing</em> on my computer.  I&#8217;m listening to music, and I remember something I needed to send him.  I&#8217;m in the middle of editing a photo and decide that I want his input.  Eleven (11) keystrokes.

Quicksilver pays attention to how often I use certain things.  At this point, I&#8217;ve opened my chat client, Adium, so many times from Quicksilver, as soon as I hit &#8220;A&#8230;&#8221; for &#8220;Adium,&#8221; it has that application selected.  A tap of enter to run it.  Four (4) keystrokes.

Another plugin that I use a lot for Quicksilver is the Search Engine plugin.  How many times a day do you &#8220;Google&#8221; (to use the parlance of our times)?  IMDB?  Amazon?  YouTube?  An average day see ~50 search engine queries for me.  The few things I dislike as much as navigating to http://www.google.com (aside from checking internet connectivity) include going to the dentist and vacuuming out my car.  I can query any engine from Quicksilver.

With the example of Google, to let Quicksilver know about this search engine, and interface it, I navigate to the search page (cringe), and submit the query &#8220;***&#8221; .  That will take me to a URL roughly like &#8220;http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&hl=en&q=***&btnG=Google+Search.&#8221;  Bookmark this page in Safari or Firefox or your browser of choice.  As soon as Quicksilver reindexes your bookmarks (you can tell it to right after you bookmark it, or play the waiting game), you can search Google.  Ctrl + Space to open Quicksilver, &#8220;Goo&#8230;&#8221; to bring up &#8220;Google&#8221; or whatever you bookmarked that page as, Enter, and type your query.  It opens the results in a new tab (or window if you prefer) in your default browser.

<ul>
	<li>ctrl + space (2)</li>
	<li>&#8220;Go&#8230;&#8221; (2)</li>
	<li>enter (1)</li>
	<li>&#8220;fubar&#8221; (5)</li>
	<li>enter (1)</li>
</ul>

Quicksilver has myriad other uses ranging from emptying your trash, to turning your computer off after a delay or at a certain time, to controlling iTunes, to performing quick calculations without opening Calculator.

  <div class="entry-content">I first read about Grand Central a few months ago, while overseas.  It was open and free, but limited to the U.S., and so I put it on a list of things to do once I got back.

I checked up on it again once back in the motherland, and Google had since bought it, and it was invite-only.  Armed with my invite, I signed up today, and am going to be using my new for-the-rest-of-my-life phone number.  It&#8217;s exciting.

For those of you who haven&#8217;t heard of it, it&#8217;s a system where you can get a number local to you, and then when people call that number, all your phones ring - your cell phone, your home phone, your work extension, whichever.  Of course this is configurable, and it&#8217;s even configurable by groups of contacts, so that when your mother in law calls, only your house phone will ring, but if it&#8217;s your adrenaline-junky emergency-room-frequenting brother, it will ring all your phones.  Answer any phone.

It can screen unknown callers, and give each of your groups a different voicemail greeting.  And speaking of voicemails, they are now all centralized, and organized like an e-mail inbox.  No more checking your cell phone voicemail, and then your home, and then your Gizmo account&#8217;s.  There&#8217;s even a feature to listen in to the voicemail message before you pick up, and you can start/stop recording phone calls simply by pressing &#8216;4.&#8217;

What excited me most about this prospect is that it removes the tie between the implementation of your phone system (service providers, frequently changing cell phones / cell phone numbers) from how your friends and family interact with you.  Until the day I die, I could conceivably keep this same number.

  <div class="entry-content">I saw an interesting video blog on making carbonated fruit ( http://www.instructables.com/id/EZETHSWF1B3RB5H/ ), and decided to go scrounge around for some supplies to make some.<br /><br />My went to the hardware store, and I bought a mason jar (in general, not a good idea to use glass for this project), because all the sturdy plastic containers were really expensive.  In the demonstration I saw, they used a nalgene.  I then went downtown with a friend, and on our way back, we stopped at Baskin Robbins and bought some ice cream and dry ice.  Back home, threw some fruit in the jar with some dry ice, put it in a cloth bag (to hopefully reduce/elliminate any shrapnel, and stuck it in the fridge.<br /><br />There was one&#8230; extra opportunity.  You don&#8217;t need very much dry ice for the fruit, and so we had some left over.  I may have called up some friends and may have asked them to collect their plastic bottles and meet me.  We may have set off some dry ice bombs.<br /><br />They&#8217;re relatively harmless, and in a country that doesn&#8217;t seem to regulate fireworks very strictly, it seemed like a pretty safe thing.  With plastic bottles, you typically get only a couple pieces of shrapnel, but the bark is worse than the bite.  A dry ice bomb is essentially putting dry ice into a plastic bottle (use gloves - dry ice can burn you) and add water to speed up the process (dry ice sublimes, giving off copious amounts of CO2; adding water makes it sublime faster by increasing the heat around the dry ice).  Place cap on tight and throw.  The ones we made took several minutes to explode, and some of them needed a little extra something. Some people enjoy shooting these with BBs for that little last activation energy, but lacking one, we decided to throw these against the concrete.  We had a couple interesting moments when we didn&#8217;t throw them far enough away from the group, and it just flew straight up and straight back down.  We had a couple explode in our hands, too (it wasn&#8217;t too bad; I wouldn&#8217;t recommend trying to make this happen, however).<br /><br />With our last one, we apparently upset someone, and we heard someone yell very loudly at us in Japanese.  We ran off, but one person in our group lost his kippah when jumping a fence, and so we needed to go back.  I went down to get it, and the others kept a lookout from one of our apartments.  I was about halfway there when they called me back, saying that the guy who yelled at us was walking around.  We decided to ride our bikes past the scene, and as we did, there was a middle-aged man walking with the guy who yelled at us, holding a baseball bat.  As we neared him, he held it up threateningly - and we were just passers-by!<br /><br />About an hour later they stopped looking and we were able to get it back, but who the hell brings a baseball bat for hearing a boom?  Granted, it could be a little freaky, but a baseball bat?
