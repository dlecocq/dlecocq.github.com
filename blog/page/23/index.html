  <div class="entry-content">I met with my professor this week, and he said that my project seemed good.  I have been working on it for a couple months now, and needed his approval in order to complete it, so I&#8217;m glad to have gotten it.  There&#8217;s still a lot more to be done, and I have to give a couple of brief presentations (one, I think has to be 日本語で, but I&#8217;m not entirely certain).  There&#8217;s also an abstract we&#8217;re supposed to write when all is said and done, but it&#8217;s trivial.<br /><br />Japanese test tomorrow.  Yesterday I started working my way through the 573 words we are supposed to know.  I still have 170 left, and it&#8217;s 1 pm, day before.  I&#8217;ll have the vocab under control by then, but I still have to worry about the grammar portion.

  <div class="entry-content">We&#8217;ve finally gotten into the warm weather here in Sendai, with up to 21 C (70 F).  I bought a lawn chair and enjoyed my first chance to stretch out on my porch with a beer in hand.  I could get used to sunlight.<br /><br />I bought a video camera that I&#8217;m excited to use.  This means that friends and family will actually see some pictures when I get back (if you&#8217;re lucky!), so look forward to it.  Hopefully it won&#8217;t be boring vacation clips.  ( http://www.amazon.com/VPC-CA6OR-Weatherproof-Digital-Camcorder-Optical/dp/B000DZKVSS/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3/102-2275879-9761733?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1177905210&sr=8-3 )<br /><br />It turns out, I&#8217;ve listened to approximately 26 days of music in iTunes since I bought my Mac in December.  That&#8217;s roughly 1/5th my life listening to iTunes.  I find this relatively surprising.

  <div class="entry-content">I love train rides.  I like watching the people on them - some kids, all with their cell phones out, talking and laughing, some tourists, but mostly people who are tired and want nothing more than to get home.  I like watching the scenery - mostly apartment buildings with the laundry out to dry, but some parks and trees.<br /><br />It&#8217;s spring, and the cherry blossoms are beginning to come out.  Most trees are about half-way - buds bursting forth, but others lazing.<br /><br />We pull into a stop a few stations from my destination, and the window across the way is filled with a tree in full bloom.  I try to appreciate it, but more than the tree itself, I am enjoying being able to just sit on the train, having it as a backdrop more than anything.<br /><br />An announcement I don&#8217;t understand, and an unusually long wait.  The local trains will occasionally stop for a few minutes if they&#8217;re ahead of schedule, but not this long.  Ten minutes, and then fifteen.  Another announcement I don&#8217;t understand.  A man on the other side of the train stares, like he&#8217;s lost in thought, but I think he&#8217;s enjoying being homeward-bound.<br /><br />Eyes all through the train look up, except for this man.  I follow their gaze, and find four men carry someone on a stretcher.  I can&#8217;t see the face, because someone&#8217;s sweater covers it, and others cover the rest of the body.  A fifth man walks behind them carrying a backpack - I assume the deceased&#8217;s.  <br /><br />First I thought it was a little ironic, the whole &#8220;things coming to life, cherry blossoms budding&#8221; thing in light of this, but then I actually wonder if the guy wouldn&#8217;t have killed himself if he could have gotten laid five minutes before that.  I don&#8217;t know why I thought that, and I admit I felt a little bad about it, but still.<br /><br />Twenty minutes later, we&#8217;re at my stop, and I get off - the end of the line.  I told myself I should go look at the front of the train to see the damage, but I forgot.  They probably wouldn&#8217;t have let people see, anyway.

  <div class="entry-content">After being in Japan for 6 months, I finally felt my first earthquake.  This is by no means the first one I&#8217;ve been through, but I&#8217;ve been asleep the other times.<br /><br />10 km +/- 11 km east of Sendai, we felt some wobble while watching a movie.  At first I thought it might have been someone jumping around on the floor above me, but then it happened again.  I gave my friend a high-five, as it was the first one he was awake for, too.<br /><br />The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has a website on which you can see earthquake information within half an hour of one anywhere in the world.  After the movie finished, we hopped onto the site, and looked ours up.  (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/recenteqsww/Quakes/us2007auay.php)<br /><br />They even provide a service that e-mails you when earthquakes happen in regions you say you have an interest in.  I might sign up for Japan&#8217;s, just so I can get emails equivalent to &#8220;Hello, you just had an earthquake.&#8221;

Or do you want to learn Japanese?&#8221;<br />&#8220;Eh, my ship, I want make more money. Eh, Japanese.&#8221;<br /><br />There are quite a few Russian sailors in Japan, especially in the port cities (and Sendai is a fairly large port city).  In some places I&#8217;ve seen (like in Otaru), signs appear only in Japanese and Russian - not Japanese and English.  I hadn&#8217;t met any Russian sailors, but it didn&#8217;t surprise me to see one.<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;m not exactly sure where you can learn Japanese.&#8221;<br />&#8220;Girls.&#8221;<br />&#8220;Excuse me?&#8221;<br />&#8220;Alcohol.

  <div class="entry-content">In the last week I have been snowboarding four times, and I am sore and exhausted.

I went at the end of last week with Alan who was up visiting from Kyoto.  (Alan and I went to high school together.)  That was a nice easy day - Alan wasn&#8217;t feeling particularly adventurous.

Sunday night Michael and Bjorn knock on my door and ask me if I want to go to to Yamagata Zao for a couple of days.  17,000 yen (about $150) for 2 day passes, two home-cooked meals, and a place to sleep.  Not too shabby.

山形 (Yamagata) Zao ski resort has about 40 lifts, 5 of which are gondolas, and what looked like some pretty promising boarding.  Equipment problems, 70 mph wind gusts and temperatures below -10 C changed that, though.

I had borrowed a board from the school, and the bindings were giving me all kinds of trouble, and my gloves quickly turned into mittens after fingers start to freeze together.

The first day, the top of the mountain is closed because of wind, but we had a few good runs around the mountain.  The second day let us see the top (with almost zero visibility - you could only see about 5-10 m away), and a couple of 30 degree slopes.  Powder was pretty good in some spots, but there was ice aplenty.

I just got back from a little trip to my favorite resort (面白山 Omosiroyama), where they still had some of the foot of snow they got this week.  Powder was pretty solid in spots, more equipment problems, but I felt pretty good overall.  I found myself tackling some slopes I didn&#8217;t think I would be able to handle this season.  A few sections were steep enough that you could reach out horizontally to touch the mountain as you&#8217;re riding down!  That was pretty awesome.

I left a little early (around 3), and while waiting for the train, a couple in their 50&#8217;s approached me and started making conversation.  We talked about where I was from, and my major, what they did before they retired, etc., and then the woman remarked that I looked like Tom Cruise.  &#8220;He looks like he could be his kid!&#8221; the man replied.

Call me crazy, but I think I&#8217;m a far cry from Tom Cruise (I&#8217;m pictured in what I was wearing at the time):

The whole thing reminded me of the following Family Guy clip:
<object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/z1ZbZvYp460"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/z1ZbZvYp460" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object>

I admit that when I first got here, I had some of the All-Japanese-People-Look-The-Same syndrome going on, but now I find it pretty easy to recognize my Asian compadres.

- Tom Cruise

  <div class="entry-content">Five days.<br /><br />Two boat rides, two hotels.<br /><br />Dozens of bus, train and subway rides, a couple of cabs, bike rides, and countless kilometers walked.<br /><br />The 58th Sapporo Snow Festival.<br /><br />I went with eight other JYPE students on the ferry between Sendai and Sapporo, and the ride was a lot of fun!  We went out on the deck for a while, and as you might have suspected, it&#8217;s pretty cold in the northern Pacific.<br /><br />14 hours on the boat there, leaving at 8 PM.  The room we got wasn&#8217;t so much a room so much as a bed.  They have these large rooms on the ship where 20 people sleep on futons, with a kind of foam-brick-like pillow (apparently relatively common in Japan).  Very relaxing sleeping at sea.<br /><br />Before sleep, and while amusing ourselves with poker and some Chinese card games we learned, a couple of Japanese guys who were heading off to bed handed us their half-finished bottle of Gilbey&#8217;s vodka.  (In some cultures, &#8220;Gilbey&#8217;s&#8221; translates to &#8220;rubbing alcohol&#8221;.)  We didn&#8217;t touch it, but when we were done playing cards, we kept the dream alive by passing it to another group of Americans.<br /><br />Woke up for about an hour to see the sunrise.  Unfortunately, the cloudcover didn&#8217;t let us see much.  Glad to have tried, anyway.<br /><br />We got into port around 10 the next morning, and we caught a taxi to the train station for the 12 o&#8217;clock train ride.  The train was pretty full, so we were spread all over a couple of cars.  I sat next to a Japanese woman, and she started talking almost without cease.  He name was アスカ (Aska), and she just graduated high school and was on break before heading to college in Osaka.  Not sure of her major - when I asked her about it, she made a gesture like giving herself and injection.  My guess is nurse or doctor, but hey, maybe you can major in intravenous drugs these days.<br /><br />I asked her where a good place to eat in Sapporo would be, and she said she was meeting a friend if we&#8217;d like to join.  We wanted to check into our hotel first, but we agreed to meet up later at the snow festival.  It was fun to hang out with a couple of friendly Japanese kids, and we got to practice a lot of Japanese.<br /><br />The snow festival is in three different parks, and we hit the first two on the first day.  Dozens if not hundreds of smaller sculptures from 2-3 meters in height, with maybe a half dozen or so larger international ones, most of which were about 20 meters wide by 15 meters tall and 12 meters deep.  Can you imagine!?<br /><br />At night, we went to the second, which consisted exclusively of ice sculptures.  There were even entire functioning bars carved from ice, where they were serving promotional alcohol from Smirnoff to Bailey&#8217;s.<br /><br />Dinner was たべほだい (all-you-can-eat) lamb.  Delicious.  Every 2-3 people are given a grill, and platter after platter of raw lamb.<br /><br />In the morning, we went to the last park, which was more geared towards children, it turns out.  Slides, build-your-own snowman, a life-size maze, ice golf, curling, and even one attraction where you ride in a raft that is strapped to a snowmobile.<br /><br />In the afternoon, Sapporo beer museum.  Sapporo has Japan&#8217;s first beer brewery - the founder studied for two years aus Deutchland for this undertaking.  Not bad.  Not my favorite, but relatively tasty.  Still not a fan of dark, and I was pleasantly surprised by the chocolate and the カルピス (Calpis) beer cocktails.<br /><br />Back to the train station to catch our train ride to Otaru, where we will be seeing another relatively famous snow attraction.<br /><br />In the evening, we walked the streets of Otaru, where many of the blocks are lined with hundreds of votive candles in ice candle holders.  I don&#8217;t know if love or hearts was the theme, but we must have seen at least 12 given snow hearts throughout the whole walk.<br /><br />Sleep was at a really really cheap hotel that would turn out to be our most comfortable stay.  A more traditional Japanese hotel - straw mats on the floor, robes, and very comfortable futons.  Rice paper everywhere.  Really quite beautiful.<br /><br />The next morning we wandered around Otaru (famous for glass-blowing and music boxes), and were invited into several shops.  Everything seemed to be closed, but we&#8217;d walk by a shop, and an old woman would come running out and welcome us in with great enthusiasm.  A seaweed shop was the first, and the owner was giving us sample after sample, and brought us each out two cups of tea.  I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the ploy, but we felt almost obligated to buy at least some seaweed.  Some was pretty tasty, but on the whole, meh.<br /><br />A glass-blower was next.  They welcomed us in, and asked us if we wanted to try blowing our own glasses.  It was about $20 per glass, but it was about as much to buy such a glass anyway.  I don&#8217;t want to give the impression that they showed us the glass and the tools and lets us go at it - it was very controlled, and they really do virtually everything.  You blow a little here, a little there (very gently and slowly), and when we occasionally use a tool, they guided our hand.  More interactive than watching, far less involved than the job.  I brought home a small beer mug.<br /><br />We wandered around Otaru a little more, back to Sapporo and onto the port.  The boat ride home was similar to the first, though the room for sleeping was a lot larger (housing 80 people, 30 of which were from the Japanese national guard).  Also, once we got out to sea, a <span style="font-style:italic;">lot</span> colder.  We all took a lap around the deck in tees and pants, snow and ice flying everywhere, and the boat rocking pretty steadily.  It was a lot of fun running around the deck like that - when it would rock, the ground would suddenly give way underneath you, and you&#8217;d be running almost in mid-air.<br /><br />All in all, good trip, and for reading this all, here are some pictures:<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;width:194px;font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:83%"><div style="height:194px;background:url(http://picasaweb.google.com/f/img/transparent_album_background.gif) no-repeat left"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/sowiebinich/fAheZD"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/image/sowiebinich/RdQNaWj95DE/AAAAAAAAAFw/3-CVcxA54RM/s160-c/fAheZD.jpg" width="160" height="160" style="border:none;padding:0px;margin-top:16px;"/></a></div><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/sowiebinich/fAheZD"><div style="color:#4D4D4D;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none;">札幌</div></a><div style="color:#808080"></div></div>

  <div class="entry-content">Yes, yes, it&#8217;s over.<br /><br />This has been an interesting semester, and I&#8217;ve certainly learned a lot about myself and Japanese.  Also, about the Japanese.<br /><br />Last night I began studying for my last final (Kanji), by trying to learn about 100 kanji that were going to be on the test.  It is virtually impossible to learn that many kanji in that amount of time (trying to double my kanji vocabulary overnight), but I had to try.<br /><br />Test today, went alright.<br /><br />Got a shirt I ordered in the mail:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_pFuEsHQdbuM/Rcbu_eInunI/AAAAAAAAAAM/rBfjcui4Jkc/s1600-h/Photo+100.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_pFuEsHQdbuM/Rcbu_eInunI/AAAAAAAAAAM/rBfjcui4Jkc/s320/Photo+100.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5027968808194128498" /></a><br /><br />Lastly, heading to Sapporo in a few days for the Snow Festival.

In the mean time, please enjoy this wonderful show called &#8221;<a href='http://www.dudershow.com/'>Duders</a>.&#8221;  It&#8217;s a little rough, but I think it could be/will be good.

  <div class="entry-content">It is apparently the tradition in many cities across Japan to have a little festival in mid January to burn to in luck for the new year.<br /><br />We showed up at around 5 pm at Hachiman Shrine, which was packed with more Japanese people than I have seen anywhere.  The road was roped off for several blocks leading up to the shrine (this is a 5-lane road, not a little street), and the hundred yard walk up the stairs from the entrance to the fire took the better part of a half an hour.  When we finally got there, we got a look at this enormous bonfire going, no ropes holding people back, and people throwing stuff in.<br /><br />In some of these pictures (see below) you&#8217;ll see these people in essentially a white headband and glorified shorts, and the many laboratories, classes, and companies do this.  I&#8217;m told that this tradition started when during this celebration, sake brewers wanted to prove their strength and so go around like this in the freezing weather.  And what&#8217;s more, it&#8217;s not a little jog down to the shrine warming up on the fire and then sprinting home.  They really take their time, and they walk around a lot before they even come to the shrine.  I imagine it gets chilly.<br /><br />The things that people were throwing into the fire included New Year&#8217;s decorations, but also these items (many of which had dice on them) available for purchase nearby.  A bystander who spoke English (he&#8217;s a professor at our University on another campus), was trying to tell us the significance, but it was too loud to hear, and most of it was lost on me.<br /><br />Not far from the fire, there were hundreds of little food stands or game stands (very fair-like), and we had some food, and walked around the what was practically a little village around for while and found a temple where the scantily-clad folk were going and drinking a cup of sake, and then moving on.  There was also a huge crowd in front of it all where people were waiting to throw money (in units of 5 yen) into these collection bins and ring a bell.  Off to the side, you could buy a fortune for anywhere from 100 yen (~$1 US) to 30,000+ yen (~$300+ US).<br /><br />Amazing festival, and I hope to see another again some day.<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;width:194px;font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:83%"><div style="height:194px;background:url(http://picasaweb.google.com/f/img/transparent_album_background.gif) no-repeat left"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/sowiebinich/HachimanShrine"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/sowiebinich/Ra9omQVcTkE/AAAAAAAAAHo/qkD6KnmTow0/s160-c/HachimanShrine.jpg" width="160" height="160" style="border:none;padding:0px;margin-top:16px;"/></a></div><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/sowiebinich/HachimanShrine"><div style="color:#4D4D4D;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none;">Hachiman Shrine</div></a><div style="color:#808080"></div></div>
