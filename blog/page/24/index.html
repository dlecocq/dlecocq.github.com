  <div class="entry-content">Got up around 7 this morning with the intention of going to Sendai Highland - a ski resort that&#8217;s about 35 minutes by train from here, and whose website makes no mention of skiing or snowboarding.  

The site I use to get all such information (http://snowjapan.com), said that they are in fact a resort, and gives me all this information, including that they are 5 minutes from the nearest train station (八ツ森駅).  The price is right, and it&#8217;s not a 2-hour trek like the last place I went to.  (To which I went, I suppose.)

8:10 - Hop on train.  ~35 minute ride ahead
8:50 - We haven&#8217;t stopped, but everyone carrying a snowboard (about half the people on the train) is still on, so hopes are up.  Internet information is sometimes wrong, after all.
9:00 - All the boarders get off the train, at a station whose name I don&#8217;t recognize.  There is no one to take your train ticket (they use the honor system a lot here, and don&#8217;t make a fuss if you&#8217;re dishonest.  Especially if you&#8217;re a stupid 外人 - lit. foreigner, more along the lines of &#8220;white devil&#8221;.)  I walk about 10 meters, following the other people, and I find myself at a ski lift.  I may have my ski trip after all.

I had been planning on using the ATM in the town I was planning on visiting, but this town doesn&#8217;t have one.  None of the businesses I&#8217;ve come across in Japan take credit cards, and ATMs close at about 6:00 PM, and don&#8217;t open until about 9:00 AM.  (I thought the point of an ATM was that it doesn&#8217;t need to go home and eat dinner with its family.  I can understand them being closed if there are a lot of muggings, but this is Japan.)  I&#8217;m told the nearest ATM is two towns (and train stops back the way I came), so I keep my ticket, and just hop on the next train back.

I get back to the resort Omosiri-yama (面白山) with money around 10:00, get a rental, a coin locker, and I&#8217;m on a lift by 10:10.

I fell a lot on my first run, but after that, I fell maybe 30 times the rest of the day.  I played it pretty easy at first, getting warmed up, and then I decided to try and hit the powder (of which there was A LOT).  There were these little hills I guess you&#8217;d call them, lining the runs, and just stacked with powder, so monkey see other boarders doing this, monkey try.  They&#8217;d get up the velocity and either try to go up and jump to the other side, or just come back down with a huge velocity.  A lot of crashing, but to my surprise, it&#8217;s soft and cushy!  There is no pain - only cold powder spraying your face and getting in your coat.

I spent most of the rest of the day on the intermediate and advanced runs where I got a lot of powder experience.  The speeds and slopes I can handle are really really picking up, and I felt really good on a lot of the runs.  

Biggest achievements:
<ol>
	<li>Improved speed and balance.</li>
<li>Standing up parallel to the course instead of standing up, stalling, and then turning the board.</li>
<li>No yard sales.</li>
</ol>

Next weekend I&#8217;m taking some friends back, because it&#8217;s super close, and really affordable, and great slopes and snow.

  <div class="entry-content">This has been the first week back to school after break.  Interestingly enough, there&#8217;s only about three weeks left until we get back to break, this time for two months.  What does that break hold?  Who knows.<br /><br />Things that will happen for certain: snow festival and snowboarding. <br /><br />Every year in Sapporo, they have a snow festival that lasts for like six days. Colin and others and I are planning to go, maybe be by train.  My hope, however, is that we go by boat.  Freezing waters of Japan?  Hell yeah.<br /><br />As far as snowboarding goes, mostly a matter of when friends want to go.  A lot of Colin, Keith, Zhou Peng, Nicolas, and we might even invite New York&#8217;s own John from down the hall.<br /><br />In preparation, I went out and bought グロブs (we call them gloves) from Mont Bell downtown.  They are by far the nicest and most expensive gloves I&#8217;ve ever bought in my life, but man, are they comfortable.  I&#8217;m looking forward to hitting the slopes (maybe this weekend), just to wear them.

  <div class="entry-content">I have spent a good amount of time the last couple of days either eating powder or tumbling down the mountain, and the excitement had to be measured on a logarithmic scale.

Wednesday I talked to Keith and he said that he was going skiing with a bunch of friends Thursday through Friday, and I was welcome to tag along, and so I called Collin (a kid I know from Wyoming) to see if he was interested. Keith was planning to go to the town, spend the night, ski, sleep, ski and come back, but Collin and I decided we&#8217;d try to get there in time to hit the slopes, and then spend the night, go again, and then come back. Unfortunately, it was about 1:00 AM when we got everything together, and had to catch a 6:30 train.

Little sleep that night - too excited, and no sleep on the train. We get there around 10, get everything in order, get geared up and go for it. The night before I read an online &#8220;tutorial&#8221; on snowboarding, but that can only &#8220;prepare&#8221; you so much. I (admittedly a little recklessly) ignored the tutorials suggestion, and just jumped on the beginner course. A lot of wipe-outs, goggles and hat flying everywhere, but I figured the best way to learn is try it, do your best, and get my hindquarters handed to me by the mountain.

By the end of the day, I was going down the intermediate run (very slowly and wiping out a lot), but I was enjoying myself. We got some food and checked into the hotel. Speaking of which, the room we got was enormous and way way better than our apartments. Also, very Japanese.

Second day, and lots of Tylenol and Ibuprofen later, we get on the mountain just as they open, and I&#8217;m starting to go a lot faster, and catching about 1/8 the number of edges as I was the day before. Go up to the very top (all intermediate runs), and the view is spectacular. Almost as beautiful as the Rockies, but not quite.

We had to stop around 3:30 to get our rentals in and catch the last bus at 4. We get home around 7, and I stuffed my face, went to bed, and then when I woke up, all my joints had turned to bone.

Will I do it again? Absolutely. As much and as often as my body can afford.

  <div class="entry-content">I&#8217;ve been saying all break that I was going to go skiing/snowboarding, but I&#8217;m actually going to be going tomorrow. Around 4:00 PM this afternoon, I called a friend and we made plans to spend the next couple of days in 山形 (Yamagata) skiing/snowboarding.

It&#8217;s about $150 US for transportation, a day of snowboarding with rentals, a hotel, another day of snowboarding, and then transportation back. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s too bad relative to the JASSO scholarship.

I feel like a total nerd, but I actually went online and read a tutorial on snowboarding before packing my backpack and getting some shut-eye. We leave for the train station in about four and a half hours, and we should be on the mountain by 9:30 or so. Exciting!

If I&#8217;m still alive, I will post pictures.

  <div class="entry-content">Happy New Year everyone!<br /><br />This holiday season was my first away from family, but it proved enjoyable.  I was able to talk to almost all my family back home, and even got my stocking from home.  I found a couple of good friends who were also staying in Sendai for the break, and that&#8217;s with whom I celebrated Christmas and New Years.<br /><br />For Christmas, Collin (a friend from University of Wyoming) and I went downtown and saw all the lights and got dinner.  We started off by going to one of at least a few of Sendai&#8217;s Irish pubs.  Well, I suppose they&#8217;re only Irish in the sense that they&#8217;re run by Japanese.  Japanese who have made it Ireland-themed.  They even serve both kinds of beer - Guinness <i>and</i> stout.  Then we found a nice little hole in the wall at which to try 牛たん (cow&#8217;s tongue), for which this region is apparently famous.<br /><br />The time between Christmas and New Years has been spent trying to get back into a more normal sleeping arrangement.  Instead of waking up at 5 PM, I tried to switch over to waking up around 7 AM, but to no avail.  My chance actually came with New Years.<br /><br />For New Years I bought a bottle of Champagne and Collin, Zhou Peng (from University of Beijing) and I cooked dinner and then waited for the new year on the roof listening to the Shinto shrines ringing their bells.  (Every new year, all the Shinto shrines ring the bells 108 times.  I&#8217;ve heard it&#8217;s to get rid of 108 bad spirits, but I have not verified this in any way.)  Since Japan is all in the same time zone, all of the Shrines across Japan are relatively synchronized, and in a city like Sendai with so many shrines, it was really a wonderful sound.  <br /><br />Collin and I agreed to meet up again around 6:20 to see the sunrise at a nearby shrine that sits on top of a hill.  We took a time lapse of the sunrise, which didn&#8217;t turn out super-great, but it&#8217;s still nice to have.<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;width:194px;font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:83%"><div style="height:194px;background:url(http://picasaweb.google.com/f/img/transparent_album_background.gif) no-repeat left"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/sowiebinich/Sunrise1107"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/sowiebinich/RZls_lmg5-E/AAAAAAAAAEw/FPBriiPwInw/s160-c/Sunrise1107.jpg" width="160" height="160" style="border:none;padding:0px;margin-top:16px;"/></a></div><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/sowiebinich/Sunrise1107"><div style="color:#4D4D4D;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none;">Sunrise 1/1/07</div></a><div style="color:#808080"></div></div>  <embed style="width:400px; height:326px;" id="VideoPlayback" align="middle" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=1518833875141026439&hl=en" quality="best" bgcolor="#ffffff" scale="noScale" salign="TL"  FlashVars="playerMode=embedded"> </embed>

  <div class="entry-content">I guess it was two days ago I was talking to my friend Keith about holiday plans, when he invited me to go to Matsushima with him and some other kids.  The plan was to leave at about 3:45 AM that night on bike to see the sunrise on the beach.  It sounded like a reasonably fun adventure, and I&#8217;ve heard a lot of great things about Matsushima, so I said I&#8217;d go.  I woke up at noon that day, so I figured I&#8217;d just stay up until it was time to leave, but in retrospect, it would have been better to get some sleep.<br /><br />The downward spiral:<br /><br />Around midnight, Keith called and told me that we&#8217;d be leaving around 2:45 instead, because Kurnia (a friend of ours from Indonesia) would be coming with us.  Mind you, Kurnia had just learned to ride a bicycle about a month before.  We leave the dorms on time, and everything looked good for the first half-hour or so.  <br /><br />We missed the turn onto the road we had planned on taking for the majority of the journey, but Keith said he was pretty sure he knew a more scenic alternate path, and we had planned for a little bit of padding time-wise.  We decide to take a chance.<br /><br />Around 4:00, we get pulled over by the police.  We passed them while they were driving the opposite direction, and they had slowed to a stop, but we just rode past them, thinking they were just letting us by (the road was very narrow).  They turned around and caught up with us about 200 meters later, and it was a little interesting trying to explain why four foreigners are up at four in the morning biking to another city in the freezing weather, but we got by.  Again I was surprised at how much communication could take place between us and the native Japanese-speakers, and it answered my question about how polite the police are.  (It turns out that they use the informal when speaking to us.)  They asked for our foreigner and bike registrations, and took down all of our information.  About 30 minutes later, they let us go; we never had the impression that we were in trouble and they were really friendly.<br /><br />The getting lost continues and Kurnia can&#8217;t keep up, so we each take turns biking with her behind the others.<br /><br />Around 7:00 Keith finally realizes where we are, and that we&#8217;re about 6 km from where we wanted to be, but seeing as it&#8217;s freezing and the sunrise is starting, we watch from the docks.<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;width:194px;font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:83%"><div style="height:194px;background:url(http://picasaweb.google.com/f/img/transparent_album_background.gif) no-repeat left"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/sowiebinich/tWctEH"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/sowiebinich/RY9qUUo0hgE/AAAAAAAAABg/6RbRqtptyaw/s160-c/tWctEH.jpg" width="160" height="160" style="border:none;padding:0px;margin-top:16px;"/></a></div><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/sowiebinich/tWctEH"><div style="color:#4D4D4D;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none;">松島</div></a><div style="color:#808080"></div></div><br /><br />We ate at a McDonalds (one of the only places open), and got warm.  The ride back took about 3 hours, putting us at about 7 hours of being on a bike.  I feel bad that Kurnia had such trouble keeping up, but it also would have been nice to be able to go at a regular pace.<br /><br />All in all, a bit of a Christmas Eve day adventure.

  <div class="entry-content">I know what I&#8217;ve said that I would be making the switch to Apple, but I made that leap today when my brand new MacBook arrived at my doorstep. I got my case in the mail about a week ago, and I assumed the computer would arrive in a similar fashion (a note in my mailbox would tell me I received a package and to please pick it up). Apple told me it would be here on or before the 18th, but my case got here the day after it shipped, so I had been hoping.<br /><br />After checking my mailbox, I returned to my apartment somewhat disappointed, but looking forward to Monday. A few hours, a knock on my door and a signature later, I was ready to make the switch. I have since spent the last (too many) hours installing my favorite software and setting preferences and whatnot. (You see, this isn&#8217;t really my mac switch per se - this last year I started using the schools Macs for my programming needs and was blown away. School ended, no more Mac - what&#8217;s a boy to do?)

  <div class="entry-content">My latest little heart-throb has been the reason behind more than a couple sleepless nights as of late. It&#8217;s called Visual C#.<br /><br />We met under the shade of iTunes&#8217; beautiful SDK and it was love at first sight. It&#8217;s the comfort of an old friend, C++, combined with everything I love about scripting languages, and it&#8217;s really easy to make solid GUIs (graphical user interface) with it. Not that there aren&#8217;t problems in our relationship - it runs almost painfully slow, but what it lacks in speed it makes up in flexibility.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, the only reason I&#8217;ve been messing around with it is because of iTunes&#8217; API (application public interface for those playing at home; an API allows you to write your own program that interacts with the functions of another program in a publicly described fashion; for instance, Amazon.com publishes an API that allows other websites to grab information from their website using tools that Amazon.com has written). iTunes has this habit of keeping tabs on how many times you play any given song, and when you last played it, but if you play it on your iPod, it doesn&#8217;t keep track of that. Your iPod grabs the play counts from iTunes, but when you synchronize your iPod with your iTunes library, the times you&#8217;ve played your songs on your iPod seem to disappear. One way to solve this problem is to write a script using the API published by Apple.<br /><br />There are a couple of other little tricks I&#8217;d like to teach iTunes, and so I&#8217;ve been putting together this little bundle of random tools with C#. It&#8217;s a lot of fun, and I figure it&#8217;s better than me playing Mario Cart.<strong></strong>

  <div class="entry-content">It&#8217;s snowing today in Sendai, and although it&#8217;s not the first time this year, it certainly is the most it has snowed. It&#8217;s not to the point that it&#8217;s accumulating, and it&#8217;s not likely to change this time, but that&#8217;s not indicative of what the rest of the winter will bring. People have told me that when the time comes, Aobayama campus (where my lab is), will remain frozen over for like three months, and there will be snow on the ground every day. Sounds like fun!<br /><br />Yesterday I finally got the internet in my dorm. It&#8217;s not very good by any means, and I have yet to be able to download anything more than a couple of megabytes, but at least I can do some of my research at home. The States clock me at around 400 kbps, Japan clocks me around 1.5 Mbps, but I haven&#8217;t gotten downloads faster than 35 kbps. I guess I&#8217;m spoiled from the dorms at Mines.<br /><br />Yesterday is also when I ordered my brand new macBook. I know I boasted before that I was making the switch, but now I have. I couldn&#8217;t place my order through the US site as they don&#8217;t ship internationally, so I went to Apple&#8217;s Japanese site. The only trouble is, it&#8217;s in Japanese. And also, you have to input your shipping address in kanji. Who wants to deal with that? I&#8217;m very fortunate that they have a service hotline in English, and I called up, greeted with Japanese, and I asked them as best as I could in Japanese if they spoke English. The woman explained in a phonetically-memorized script that she was sorry that no English speakers were available, and if she could please have my phone number, a representative would call back shortly. A few minutes later, I was on the phone with Kuni, whose English impressed me. He helped me place my order, get my student discount (interestingly enough, I didn&#8217;t need to provide any authentication that I was actually a student) and all that.<br /><br />I got the white macBook Intel Core 2 Duo 2.0 GHz, upgraded to 2 gigs of ram, and even a US keyboard layout. They said it should be a few days before it ships, and then it should be on my doorstep between December 15 and 20. In retrospect, I think I may have chosen a poor time to order.

  <div class="entry-content">On Friday night, some friends and I got together for a little bit of drinking, and some public humiliation. Stan was supposed to ask this girl out by Friday, and since he didn&#8217;t, he had to be publicly humiliated.<br /><br />At any rate, the point of all this is that while there, we played on David&#8217;s Playstation 3, for which he paid about $650 US. I think that&#8217;s a little much for a game console, but it is not without merit. Amazing graphics.<br /><br />While there, I met this Guatemalan man and his girlfriend. He was a philosophical drunk, and he was trying to tell me about love. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to marry this girl,&#8221; he said, putting his arm around her and pointing. &#8220;Except, she has an artificial heart and cannot love anyone.&#8221; He kept asking me to speak to him in Spanish, but my Spanish was never that advanced to begin with, and so we ended up speaking this confusing melange of Spanish, Japanese and English. Every couple of minutes he would turn to her and make out for about 30 seconds and then turn back to me to continue talking. Maybe it&#8217;s a Guatemalan thing?<br /><br />Earlier in the week, we had our kanji midterm, and I&#8217;m pretty sure I got an A, but I think they had mercy for us and made the test easier than they had to. I was more than a little nervous going into it, and the thing that troubled me the most on the exam was the pronunciation of the kanji. Glad to have that done with, and it was my only midterm. It&#8217;s weird to be only half-done with the semester when stateside people are starting finals.<br /><br />On Saturday we went to a nomihodai place (one of my favorites because they serve a bunch of food and the drinks are pretty decent), and I tried umeshyu (I&#8217;m uncertain how to spell is in romaji - 梅酒), but it translates to plum alcohol or plum wine. It&#8217;s very very sweet, and though I do not enjoy a plum, this was amazing. I&#8217;m not sure about its availability in the States, but if you get a chance, try it.<br /><br />Grace a Yamaya (which could literally be translated as mountain store) - a store that specializes in alcohol and imported foods, we found cachaça (fermented sugar cane). Alan tells me that it&#8217;s the favorite drink of Brazil, and this particular bottle we bought was actually a Brazilian brand. Most of the people here who are even remotely social drink quite a bit, and so I&#8217;m hoping to host a cachaça night so we can socialize and discover Brazil&#8217;s culture through alcohol. The only problem is, we can&#8217;t find limes, which you need to make caipirinha (why we wanted the cachaça).<br /><br />Drinking isn&#8217;t all I do here - there just happened to be two parties this weekend. And, don&#8217;t worry mom - we&#8217;re all responsible adults and take care of each other. Smokey the bear says, &#8220;Friends don&#8217;t let friends bike home drunk.&#8221;
