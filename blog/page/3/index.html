  <div class="entry-content">If you find yourself with a terminal and you need a stopwatch:
<code>
$> time cat
</code>

Cat(1) by default waits on stdin if no arguments are provided, until an EOF is reached (Ctrl+d). Time(1) waits until the run command terminates, so in effect, it&#8217;s a stopwatch that runs until you press ctrl+d.

  <div class="entry-content">Recently I&#8217;ve been working on porting some code to Mac, and yesterday I ran into a bug that stumped me for a little bit. Compiling against Boost was raising a bunch of errors, specifically in lines that seemed pretty innocuous (from cstdint.hpp):
<code>
  using ::int8_t;
  using ::int_least8_t;
  using ::int_fast8_t;
  using ::uint8_t;
  using ::uint_least8_t;
  using ::uint_fast8_t;
</code>

G++ kept giving me errors for each of those lines: &#8220;error: expected unqualified-id before ‘signed’,&#8221; referring to the line &#8220;using ::int8_t.&#8221; I&#8217;m a little embarrassed that I couldn&#8217;t figure it out right away, but eventually I figured out that it was caused by int8_t being #define&#8217;d somewhere else. For those of you that don&#8217;t know, #define really just takes one term and substitutes every subsequent occurrence of that term with one you provide. 
<code>
// If you define it as a macro
#define int8_t signed char
// Then this line will be interpreted very differently from how you expect
using ::int8_t;
// Gets interpreted as "using ::signed char"!!!
</code>

And this is what g++ had been complaining about. That is not legal C++ syntax; I&#8217;m sorry I doubted you, g++! But there still remained a larger question: where were these types getting defined? I didn&#8217;t want to be in the business of &#8220;patching&#8221; a library, and especially the largely impeccable Boost library. Typically these types (int8_t, uint8_t, etc.) are defined in cstdint or stdint.h, but looking at the system&#8217;s version, I found to my surprise that they were not macro-defined, but typedef&#8217;d, which is the right way to do it.

<strong>Sidebar:</strong> In general, you should be using typedef instead of #define for this reason, and another very good reason. Because #define macros just go through code and blindly replace references, it can be difficult to trace the origin of a type, but typedefs are carried through, and so even after preprocessing, you can still see what the semantic meaning was (that you wanted int8_t specifically, not just something that happens to be the same type). And when debugging, this extra type information can be helpful. Similarly, you should generally also use const to define constants in your code, instead of #define macros, because while you might remember what a magic number is when you write it into your library, the meaning of that particular constant becomes unclear when you encounter it&#8217;s value when debugging. (If you haven&#8217;t, read <a href="http://www.aristeia.com/books.html">Scott Meyer&#8217;s Effective C++</a>.)

Getting back to the morality tale, the library I was porting wasn&#8217;t macro-defining int8_t, and stdint.h wasn&#8217;t, so where was the culprit? Clearly there are potentially hundreds of places it could be, and I was running out of good guesses. Luckily, SEOmoz C++ shaman Martin taught me a little <strong>ninja magic</strong>: use the -E flag with g++ to only run the preprocessor stage, and redirect the output into a file! When compiling with &#8216;make,&#8217; it typically spits out the offending g++ command, so rerun it to just pass that one through the preprocessor, which reaches out and fetches the header files and gloms them in order into one giant input file. Then, step through <em>this</em> file to see where &#8220;define&#8221; and &#8220;int8_t&#8221; occur on the same line! In two minutes we were able to find the header that was causing all this trouble, where I had spent two hours learning and reading about where the problem might be.

In the end we found it in a very small library that we happened to use, and on Mac we had just been using a slightly old version and this problem had been fixed in subsequent releases. Still, I&#8217;m glad to have added this preprocessor trick to my toolkit.

  <div class="entry-content">I had an interview a few weeks ago, and I spent a little time preparing for it. I puzzled over some logic problems, and read some common interview questions, knowing that there would still likely be questions I hadn&#8217;t heard. Still, I did have one cache hit, so to speak.

One of my favorite questions, though, was one about pouring bottles of champagne: Suppose you are in charge of pouring the champagne for the midnight toast at a prestigious party with more VIPs than you can count. You have 10 waiters, who are wheeling in 1000 bottles of champagne and some bad news; exactly one of these bottles is poisoned, and if you drink even a single drop, you will become violently ill in one hour. If you serve tainted champagne to any guest, you and your employees will be fired on the spot.

Your waiters are sympathetic to this fact, and have thus volunteered to be taste-testers &#8211; a night home on the couch being miserable is better than being unemployed. Though, because of time constraints, you only have time for one testing before people get sick and you have to serve champagne.

The naive approach is to split the bottles up into groups of 100, and have each waiter try a drop from each. You would know from whichever waiter gets sick which group of 100 bottles has the bad bottle, but there would be 99 good bottles wasted, and of course, the wasted good bottles get deducted from your pay.

So, you want everyone to keep their jobs (and not serve tainted booze) while wasting as few good bottles as possible. How many bottles do you have to waste? Click below to reveal solution.

<spoiler>
You don&#8217;t have to waste a single bottle of good champagne, while ensuring that no VIP gets sick. Label your waiters 1, 2, 3, and so on up to 10. Label the bottles of champagne 1, 2, 3, and so on up to 1000. Then, for each bottle, convert that number to binary representations, and let each waiter be associated with a bit. For example, bottle 417 has representation 0110100001, meaning that waiters 1, 6, 8, and 9 would sample a small drop from it, but bottle 418 would have waiters 2, 6, 8, and 9. In this way, each bottle has a unique set of waiters who sampled it. Then, when waiters start becoming sick, say, waiters 3, 5, 6, and 10, you&#8217;d know that it&#8217;s bottle 1000110100 (564) that&#8217;s contaminated.

  <div class="entry-content">In the vein of habits I wish I had picked up in Software Engineering, I&#8217;ve been increasingly using unit tests. Working on a project recently with a friend of mine, it fell to me to pick out a unit testing library for our development.

My uninformed search led me to <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit">QUnit</a>, from the same people that bring us <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, which we already use heavily. We found it immediately simple to use, expressive and powerful. Much of this particular site involves AJAX, and as such, we wanted to be able to test and make sure our interface to these resources is working, as well. Not to mention that most operations rely on information retrieved from remote resources.

To that end, the vast majority of our tests use their <code>asyncTest</code> function, which lets you perform any kind of asynchronous request, and then in your callback, you indicate to the system that your test has all its necessary information and can continue. For example,

<code>
asyncTest("Our Site's API", function() {
	$.ajax({...
	success: function(response) {
		ok('data' in response, "We expect data in the response.");
		}
	}
}
</code>

One big &#8216;get&#8217; in my mind is that it&#8217;s from the same group that produces a library we already use heavily, so they tend to be thought-out in similar ways. Plus, it runs in the browser, and has nice styling for the interface that make your unit tests look extra classy!

The QUnit site has a lot more examples and demos, but this concludes my shameless plug for a unit testing quite I&#8217;ve come to appreciate very much.

  <div class="entry-content"><a href="http://book.git-scm.com/">Git</a> is not a complicated tool for most things. I still find it a little tricky to set up for multiple users, but even that&#8217;s pretty easy. It really caters to the use-case where you&#8217;re just starting a project, or are the sole developer, but just want to keep track of changes and versions, make branches, etc.

The first major point of git is that everyone has their own copy of the repository. When you commit changes, you commit them to your local copy of the repository. If you are working on a group project, there is a shared resource that can be <strong>pushed to</strong> and <strong>pulled from</strong>, but I actually like that it takes an extra command to do that &#8211; it forces me to make sure that it&#8217;s what I actually want to do. Now, to the bare-bones commands:
<ol>
	<li><strong>git init</strong> &#8211; Wherever you&#8217;re writing your code, type &#8220;git init&#8221;. It creates an empty repository in that directory (there&#8217;s a magical hidden folder &#8220;.git&#8221; that gets created and knows things).</li>
	<li><strong>git status</strong> &#8211; Git knows which files have changed since you last saved changes, and it will happily tell you which files are new and changed with this command.</li>
	<li><strong>git add</strong> &#8211; When you change files and are at a point where it make sense to save changes to your code (a bug fix, a new feature, etc.), then tell git which files you want to put in this commit  with &#8220;git add&#8221;. If committing a set of changes with git is like shooting a gun, then adding files to be committed is like loading that gun. Git knows which files have changed, but it can make sense to group changed files into different logical commits. For example, if you fix two bugs between commits, you might want to add the changes for each bug fix separately.</li>
	<li><strong>git commit</strong> &#8211; When you have added a bunch of changed files to be committed, now you&#8217;re ready to actually commit those changes. Type &#8220;git commit -m &#8216;A short, meaningful summary of the changes that happened.&#8217;&#8221;</li>
</ol>

There is a lot more to git, and a <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial.html">million tutorials</a>, that will explain things in more detail, but these are the commands I spend 95% of my time using, and enough to at least get you starting tracking changes for anything and everything. It doesn&#8217;t matter very much what version control you use, <strong>just use something.</strong>

  <div class="entry-content">For a recent project, we were looking for an issue tracker. Our biggest criteria was something that was free &#8211; we weren&#8217;t planning on doing anything complicated, and so available issue trackers were essentially equal in our eyes. We ended up going with <a href="http://unfuddle.com/">Unfuddle</a>, but it wasn&#8217;t until after signing up that we discovered its biggest strength: an API.

There are other issue trackers with an API, but this one seemed reasonable enough so we used it. The big get for us in building a web-based app, is that it <strong>lowers the barrier for reporting bugs</strong>. We set up our development server to include a bug-reporting button that collected a little report that then sent it to our server, which uses the Unfuddle API to add a ticket. It also records and submits a little information about the user&#8217;s browser, current session, etc. that might help in debugging their problem.
 
Not the most complicated or profound system in the world, but it does put user-reported (and tester-reported) bugs in the same place we check our to-dos and other issues. No checking a support email account we remember once a month. Just puts bugs right were we&#8217;re looking anyway. I hope to share a little bit of the backend code soon!

  <div class="entry-content">Until recently, I bore the burden of a dirty little secret: I didn&#8217;t use unit testing. I don&#8217;t know if this has been other students&#8217; experience, but my software engineering course could have been a lot better. Perhaps it&#8217;s a topic that requires students to determine their own level of involvement, but particularly, I am irked that these issues were not as developed as they could have been:
<ol>	
	<li>Version control - svn, git, something! Anything, really! Just use something!</li>
	<li>Unit testing - sure we talked about it, but its utility isn&#8217;t clear until you use it in earnest</li>
	<li>Documentation - always felt more like a chore than a tool</li>
	<li>Issue tracking - <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000029.html">Joel on Software</a> said it best: &#8220;I was born with only two bug-storing-slots in my brain.&#8221;</li>
	<li>More best practices - <a href="http://www.aristeia.com/books.html">Effective C++</a> (it&#8217;s worth it &#8211; get it and read it) alone was worth more than the course was.
</ol>

I concede that these are things whose utility might be hard to convey to college students who may or may not be working on projects they really believe in. Still, very important.

One of the things I like about documentation is that you can refer to the documentation when uncertain about side-effects, input, etc. of functions and you don&#8217;t really feel like reading through code and trying to keep it in your brain-RAM. Not only that, but I usually refer to my own documentation to get an idea of the guarantee that a function was offering, to try to make sure that it&#8217;s making those <strong>same guarantees after I make changes</strong>. Not only this, but <strong>articulating functionality crystalizes it&#8217;s implications</strong> in your mind. When describing how something works to a friend, it often reminds you of issues you hadn&#8217;t considered. Writing documentation is the same in this respect.

When working with other people, while it&#8217;s nice to be able to talk face-to-face, the issues we think of that need changing go in one ear and out the other for me. Not that it wasn&#8217;t a good idea, but my brain-RAM is not infinite. <strong>Bugs, features, ideas, issues all get paged out of my head. Write them down instead,</strong> which is where issue tracking comes in. Design questions and decisions come out of issues all the time, and the trail of comments and discussion make a nice reference for documentation.

I find that when I&#8217;m fixing a bug, the functionality of that chunk of code gets reduced to that particular feature in my mind. So, if when I try using it, if that bug is fixed, then my job is done. But we&#8217;ve all experienced unintended side effects, where in fixing one thing, we break another. Having a list of features to check is a step up from trying to remember the things that need to work, but it&#8217;s much less than the power of unit testing. I&#8217;ve recently been using <a href="http://unittest-cpp.sourceforge.net/UnitTest++.html">UnitTest++</a> for C++ applications, and <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit">QUnit</a> from the jQuery people, and have been pleased to thrilled. It allows you to <strong>check functionality exhaustively and quickly on a whim</strong>. Even the task of <strong>writing the tests forces you to define the functional requirements of your code</strong>, and I find it helps to clarify a lot.

Version control lets you try crazy new approaches and track changes, isn&#8217;t that great? I was helping a friend last semester with some of his code, and he was trying to make code changes with copy, paste, and the undo buffer. In the end, he ended up introducing more bugs into the code than he was fixing. <strong>It&#8217;s intractable to keep these kinds of code changes in your brain-RAM.</strong> Use something, use anything. I have a qualm with svn because it was something I used so rarely, I could never remember how to set it up. <strong>Even a barrier as small as that was enough to prevent me from using version control at all.</strong> I love git because it&#8217;s so easy to set up, I use it for almost anything: from a report (if using LaTeX), to a weekend project, to my thesis. There are tons of tools out there, but <strong>just use something.</strong>
