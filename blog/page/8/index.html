  <div class="entry-content">I&#8217;m all for sharpening the saw, and working on little puzzles.  In that vein, I recently came across a site called <a href="http://programmingpraxis.com/">Programming Praxis</a> that suggests tasks from implementing heapsort to writing AI to play the game <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000DMBF?ie=UTF8&tag=dan.lecocq-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00000DMBF">Mastermind</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=dan.lecocq-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00000DMBF" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.

I don&#8217;t work on their puzzles as often as I like, but if you&#8217;ve got a little bit of free time, they&#8217;re worth checking out.

  <div class="entry-content">A short while ago I posted a new release of OpenGLot, which featured parametric curves, scalar fields, contour lines and flow fields all implemented in GLSL shaders.

And they support time dependence.

It can plot virtually any function in x, y and t, and on my MacBook with its NVIDIA GeForce 9400M it has been getting 10k+ fps.  I&#8217;m still a little surprised by this number, but it seems to be running at that speed.

They&#39;re currently streamlines, but in the near future I hope to support streaklines and particle flow as well.&#8221;]<a href="http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/flow.png"><img src="http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/flow-300x281.png" alt="Flow (vector) fields appear as advected dye.

On of the great thing about implementing this on the graphics card is that it doesn&#8217;t require much CPU time on the machine running it.  Even at 10k frames per second, my MacBook never uses more than 30% of a single core&#8217;s time.  A place where this particularly shines is on tiled displays - a bunch of HDTVs tiled together to run as if it were one large screen.  In such setups, a computer will control 2-4 screens, and each computer&#8217;s graphics card has enough power to run the animation for its portion of the screen.  There are still some bugs to be worked out, but I ran a proof-of-concept on one of the tiled displays at KAUST.

[caption id=&#8221;attachment_752&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;Running a demo of OpenGLot on a KAUST tiled display&#8221;]<a href="http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_0014.JPG"><img src="http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_0014-300x225.jpg" alt="Running a demo of OpenGLot on a KAUST tiled display" title="IMG_0014" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-752" /></a>[/caption]

Lately I&#8217;ve been working on getting the 3D analogs of the various 2D primitives working, again all with time dependence (it&#8217;s the support for animation that really makes this shine in my mind).  So far it&#8217;s surfaces, parametric curves and surfaces and flow fields, but the flow fields have some work yet.  It turns out that while modern hardware is definitely capable of handling 3D flow fields, it doesn&#8217;t actually make much sense when you see the result - it&#8217;s just too busy.  To be able to easily visualize flow in 3D is very much an open problem.

In order to get some interesting shapes working, I had to add support for cylindrical and spherical coordinates which is actually providing an interesting challenge - how best to generate the shaders.  The shader source code (that runs on the graphics card) is generated and compiled when you run OpenGLot, and I&#8217;ve not found an altogether easy and intuitive interface for adding simple coordinate transformations to it.  Still, it works, but the programatic interface will likely change.

In order to determine surface normals (which are something usually determined when one defines the geometry of an object), the vertex shader approximates various derivatives numerically.  So far, the shading results have been pretty decent.

I&#8217;m still working on making video of this in action available, but so far a number of the tools I would usually use have come up short.  I&#8217;ve been trying to integrate a video encoder into a utility library for OpenGLot so it can record video straight out of the box, but the framerate is still too low.

  <div class="entry-content">Yesterday morning, I woke at 6:15 to the all-to-common fire alarm.  Prepared to sleep through it if necessary, I went to my window to check for smoke or anything that might indicate that this wasn&#8217;t one of the dozens of false alarms.  What I found was rain.

<img class='aligncenter' src='http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2733/4134147273_f8f644c708.jpg' alt='DSC_0052.NEF'/>

Rain like cords was falling in Saudi Arabia.  The streets were wet, and excited, I ran to get my camera and started taking pictures.  I threw some clothes on, and ran around campus to try to document what I believe to be a very rare event here.  I called several of my friends to make sure they were awake and witnessing this.

The rain let up about 7:30, and soaked and I tired I headed back to my building to get some sleep when I encountered several other students who also wanted to just feel the rain on their faces.  We walked around campus to see it wet, but ended up surveying the damage.  Students had ceilings collapse, water running out of light fixtures, flooding in their apartments - the list goes on.

<img class='aligncenter' src='http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2614/4134918290_5723a31f52.jpg' alt='DSC_0264.NEF'/>

A sunken area of campus had turned into a lake (based on what it&#8217;s like when it&#8217;s dry, it must be 4 meters deep in some places), and some roads had become impassable rivers.  Encountering a couple of students on motorcycles unsure if they should try to cross, I was reminded of Oregon trail.  In the end, they forded the river.

<img class='aligncenter' src='http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2641/4134159051_837bef60e2.jpg' alt='DSC_0328.NEF'/>

Tyler and I moved on, the water now thigh-high in the middle of the road.  Cars&#8217; mufflers were bubbling through the water, and one had to worry about the wake of passing cars.  The womens&#8217; residence was evacuated, and many families packed their kids in the car and left in search of higher ground.  The timing was sweet and sour - it was the last day before break and school got cancelled on account of rain, but most students were leaving the country for the week, and some will return to find unlivable and extensively damaged homes.

<img class='aligncenter' src='http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2525/4134161437_eb095e2c60.jpg' alt='DSC_0352.NEF'/>

Rains like these are extremely rare in the area, and so I understand the lack of preparation.  I don&#8217;t understand the shoddy craftsmanship of the homes, but that&#8217;s a running issue.  Tonight&#8217;s Thanksgiving dinner will be a reflective one for certain.  One exasperated student, waking to water pouring on him, household wiring fried and water running down the stairs like a waterfall felt that this was the last straw.  He seemed to be set on the decision to return home at the earliest possible time.

It seems he&#8217;s not alone, and the school is expecting a non-negligible portion of the students to not return after winter break, though some are talking about not returning from Eid break at the end of next week.  I hope for all our sakes and for the sake of the school, that the administration can refocus, get their act together and get their sometimes incredible mismanagement under control.  We all came because we wanted to see KAUST succeed, and we hope it still can.

<img class='aligncenter' src='http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2486/4134926106_15238d5dfc.jpg' alt='DSC_0387.JPG'/>

That said, I would like to offer praise and criticism; the response from emergency services was what I&#8217;d expect in a modern country.  Water tankers were on the streets, pumping out massive amounts of water, within four hours of the rain.  The fire department helped evacuate a number of families, and each student was actually contacted by phone to make sure he had a livable apartment for the time being - those who did not were moved to safe lodgings.  My criticism is this - why are not all of our other, very real concerns and problems not pursued with the same tenacity and efficiency.  Why did it take a small disaster for KAUST to shine?

I took some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/danlecocq/sets/72157622877131712/">more photos</a> as well.

  <div class="entry-content">A professor of mine mentioned that he didn&#8217;t use bash but Z shell (zsh).  I asked him about his choice and he said that it happened years ago when he asked a system administrator how to accomplish a task in bash and the guy replied that it was really easy in zsh.  There have been worse reasons to switch, I suppose.

(Incidentally, the best way I&#8217;ve found to improve your command-line-fu is to work near system administrators.  They have the most amazing bits of command line ninja magic you&#8217;ll ever see.)

I decided to give it a shot this evening and after 30 minutes of use, I&#8217;m switching.  The features I&#8217;ve liked thus far as that when you want to search for a command you recently ran, you don&#8217;t need any of the ctrl-r nonsense.  One simply begins the command as he remembers it and presses up.  Old functionality mapped to the intuitive keystroke.  You can scroll through your command history by pressing the up arrow key in bash, but to search, it&#8217;s a different story.

The feature that clinched it for me is that it has better autocompletion.  If you are not using tabs to autocomplete, you are wasting keystrokes and make typos, but something I find frustrating is that when I want to ssh into some computer with some long and difficult-to-type name, I had to search my history for it.  Or, in zsh, you can tab complete the name.  It remembers that stuff!  Imagine that!

Of course, there&#8217;s a very real possibility I&#8217;ll switch back if I run into too many gotchas, but this many niceties this soon in make mean think that the good will outweigh the bad.

  <div class="entry-content">I&#8217;ve failed before, at many things, and it is a habit I can&#8217;t seem to break.  It&#8217;s inevitable that things won&#8217;t work (especially not the first time) and in fact programmers know that it&#8217;s a beautiful thing when code compiles the first time, let alone works correctly the first time.

With graphics, the results are sometimes cool, sometimes horrifying and sometimes beautiful.  I make a habit of documenting the results of broken code as much as I can, and after a recent one, I thought I&#8217;d share some of the more interesting ones.

  <div class="entry-content">I&#8217;ve been around the block a time or two (or more) with subversion, but until recently I had limited experience with git.  Sure, every now and then I&#8217;ve used it to check out projects, but not for my personal use.

No longer. And as of right now, I don&#8217;t have any intention of using anything but git for personal development.

Last week, I held lecture for parallel programming and I talked about using subversion for versioning, and I began to suspect that something was horribly wrong.  Questions started springing up - where does the repository live?  Am I calling svnadmin on my own machine?  Where do I check out the repository?  Though there are answers to these questions, for many things, such a model just doesn&#8217;t make sense.

If I&#8217;m working on a project that I&#8217;m not syncing between several computers, but I just want to have different stable versions and to try different crazy ideas using branches.  It mitigates the cost of reverting drastic changes to code.

<strong>Use Case</strong>: You&#8217;re showing someone your code, and want to show off a neat feature you&#8217;ve made, or a problem you&#8217;re encountering, something about the project, invariably you&#8217;ve run into a problem where it doesn&#8217;t compile at the moment.  You type furiously, trying to find and undo the most recent changes, but to no avail - there is no hope of getting it to compile in the 5 minutes you have someone&#8217;s attention.  Enter version control.  Revert to the last working copy and victory is yours.

In fact, just today I was asked if I could pull up some code I had been working on to show to a professor.  Unfortunately at the moment it wasn&#8217;t compiling but was able to switch versions in 20 seconds and show off some very recent work from earlier in the day, thus saving face.

<strong>Use Case</strong>: You&#8217;ve got some crazy idea for an implementation you&#8217;d like to try out, but are worried about reverting back all the massive changes you&#8217;ll have to make in the code.  Worry not!  Create a new branch and feel free to change your code in every way you can think of and not lose other branches under development.

<strong>Use Case</strong>: You&#8217;ve got multiple versions of code each implementing the same basic algorithm but with different mechanisms, techniques, etc. and have to turn it in as part of a project.  Just archive the whole directory (in a tarball or zip) and the user who unpacks it has access to every version your code has been in.  Each branch, each stage of development.  And very light-weight to boot.

I can&#8217;t speak for others, but I will be using git for the foreseeable future as it&#8217;s incredibly easy to use and alleviates many of the problems I encounter regularly with development.

  <div class="entry-content">This week for Scientific Visualization, we&#8217;re talking about volume rendering and using VTK to explore some data.  I got some datasets from <a href="http://www9.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/External/vollib/">The Volume Library</a> and after a little tinkering, got VTK to render them. (And now a quick aside on how to do this as I didn&#8217;t find much information on the subject).

I used a tool (pvm2raw) available as part of the <a href="http://www.stereofx.org/volume.html">V^3</a> library to convert the pvm files to raw, but VTK requires its own simple <a href="http://www.eichberger.de/2005/10/how-to-convert-raw-file-to-vtk.html">header</a>.  I actually found that this particular header didn&#8217;t work (perhaps a VTK versioning problem?) and so taking guidance from this, checked the header of one of the VTK-included volumes:
<code>
bash $> head VTKData/ironProt.vk
</code>

This header more or less included a little information on the grid size, spacing and representation of the data:
<code>
# vtk DataFile Version 1.0
&lt;Name of File&gt;

BINARY

DATASET STRUCTURED_POINTS

DIMENSIONS &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; &lt;z&gt;
ASPECT_RATIO 1 &lt;y/x&gt; &lt;z/x&gt;
ORIGIN 0 0 0

POINT_DATA &lt;x * y * z&gt;
SCALARS scalars &lt;unsigned_char|unsigned_short&gt;
LOOKUP_TABLE default
&lt;remember to include a newline here&gt;
</code>

Concatenating the header with the raw:
<code>
bash $> cat header CT-Head.raw > CT-Head.vtk
</code>

At that point, I was in business and was able to move on to generating pretty pictures.  Granted, these datasets are pretty sparse, but still VTK did a pretty reasonable job.  <strong>Update:</strong> a comment asked for a little bit more detail on this assignment, and so I&#8217;m including <a href='http://dan.lecocq.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/report.pdf'>my report</a> for the project.

I was amazed today that we can see inside of things&#8230; without taking them apart.  What an age to live in.  Especially the <a href="http://www.visualiseringscenter.se/1/1.0.1.0/230/1/">virtual autopsy table</a> I read about recently.  In 20 years, we&#8217;ll have Firefly-style real-time holographic body scans (ignore music, skip to 0:45):

  <div class="entry-content">I&#8217;m working on OpenGLot (my OpenGL plotting library) for a class project, and two of the features I decided to implement were contour lines and scalar fields in 2D.

A few days ago I got decent-looking contour lines working and today I got scalar fields implemented with a fragment shader.  The programmer using the library can specify a function in the form of a string and have it plotted as a scalar field.  Quickly.  Really quickly.

Modern graphics cards support shaders, which are programs that get run on the graphics card, and in parallel. This is great for algorithms that can be run in isolation (one pixel doesn&#8217;t need to know what the others are doing), which is the case here. OpenGLot generates a fragment shader that colors a single pixel based on the value of the function.  Each of the dozens or hundreds of cores on a GPU runs the same code in parallel for their particular pixel.

The graphing program I use, Grapher.app is rapidly showing its age.  The results it gives for the same function (though using a much better coloring scheme) are either grainy or extremely slow (10 or more seconds).  OpenGLot is generating these in less than 0.1 seconds.  (Grapher.app implements its scalar fields on the CPU, so comparing times is a little like comparing apples and oranges.  Still, responsiveness in this type of matter is important.)

  <div class="entry-content">In the midst of a new school, having recently left my undergraduate institution, I&#8217;ve been relatively nostalgic.  I remember my family getting its first computer.  It was a Compaq, running just a few MHz, but when my father came home one night with it, it seemed positively magical.  I had heard of computers, and seen them at school, but nothing beyond Oregon Trail.

You could change the text of the screen saver, and its font, color, etc.  This, I was sure, was awesome.

I was in the fifth grade at this point, and several weeks later my parents were meeting with their accountant in the kitchen.  I saw mysterious black box in front of the man that turned out to be a laptop.  He was staring at it intently, but from where I was I could see nothing on the screen - viewing angles just weren&#8217;t what they are today.  I slinked around and tried to catch a glimpse, but I was noticed and my parents remarked on my curiosity saying that I had never seen one before.  Slightly embarrassed, I scurried off as children do.

By the time I was in high school, I had learned about Napster, and torrents, and had learned a small amount about the hardware.  I bought my first hard drive (120 GB) for about US$100, and though it&#8217;s large compared to the 16MB disks of yore, looking back it still seems ridiculously tiny.

I eventually started playing with C++ my junior year, helped out by my friend Michael&#8217;s mother, Katja.  She was a programmer (and perhaps she still is) at Ball Aerospace, and she helped me to install Cygwin and get a compiler running.  At last, I could actually compile and run the code I had been reading about in the books I had picked up from the local library.

I was constantly aware of the differences between my programs and those of the system, an obvious difference in quality and found it easy to lose interest because of the lack of a GUI.  All the same, the power was obvious, and it was then that I first became interested in mathematical curiosities like prime numbers and Fibonacci.

When I left for school, I imagined that I might end up in computer science, but I initially registered as an electrical engineer.  When I found myself taking more CS courses than EE, I switched and embraced it.  Still, I can&#8217;t help but wonder about nature vs. nurture and what along the way (besides the obvious) pushed me in that direction.  Either way, I do not regret my career choice, and I can&#8217;t think of anything else I&#8217;d be so regularly inspired to work on.
